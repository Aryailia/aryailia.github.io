    <p>Fundamentally, "…people with Crohn disease are at risk of malnutrition, because their intestine cannot absorb all the nutrients they need from their diet."  [Source:] <a href="http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/crohns-disease">http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/crohns-disease</a><br><br><br><br>Eating a diet largely consisting of bananas and other high-fiber, carbohydrate-based foods has been found by some studies to help people cope with the disease (but please note that research is still ongoing, and, e.g., the extent to which the disorder is an autoimmune dysfunction is still debated). [Source:] <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/519185">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/519185</a><br><br><br><br>On Crohn's disease in general, and with a description of the type of steroids typically used in treatment (and their side-effects, etc.):<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_Crohn">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_Crohn</a>'s_disease<br><br><br><br>Suddenly, Durianrider's more absurd advice (quoted in an earlier video) that a person getting zero exercise should be able to eat unlimited calories without gaining weight (etc.) "makes sense" in reference to his own, direct experience: Crohn's disease would fundamentally change the way he perceives diet, exercise, weight-gain, and how much he needs to eat to feel energetic (etc.).  His needs (and his ability to gain weight) will be radically different from those of an average/healthy person.<br><br><br><br>His experience with the disease might have given him some terrible experiences with the side-effects of cortico-steroids, and, more generally, the extent to which people suffering from the condition will have extreme changes in their (subjective) health corresponding to (sometimes minor) changes in their diet.<br><br><br><br>For someone with Crohn's disease, switching to a vegan, high-fiber diet, could indeed come as "a revelation", if their former diet had been aggravating their symptoms.  What he says about fatigue, having enough energy, etc., suddenly "makes sense" when you know that he has Crohn's disease (even though it is TERRIBLE advice for 99% of the population!).<br><br><br><br>In the video linked to below, D.R. sincerely says that eating A HUGE QUANTITY of carbs will "cure" chronic fatigue syndrome; from anyone else, this would just sound crazy (or stupid… certainly unscientific)… but it is actually easy to imagine how someone struggling with Crohn's disease could perceive things this way.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/kTgozmZCHcU?t=1m5s">https://youtu.be/kTgozmZCHcU?t=1m5s</a><br><br><br><br>If he were honest and scientifically-rigorous about it, Durianrider's experience probably could be useful for other people with Crohn's disease to learn from (and they may be the only people who really could/should eat 30 bananas per day!)… but, instead, he has been dishonest, insulting and extremely aggressive, (1) imagining himself to be miraculously cured, and (2) dismissing anyone who doesn't get results similar to his own as secretly eating hamburgers (etc.), claiming that gaining weight on his diet is "impossible" (etc.)… when, in reality, his perspective and experience are shaped by an extreme and incurable disease.  Sad.<br><br><br><br>It already was a strange irony that a guy who had been diagnosed with anorexia (and as an ex-drug-addict, etc.) was in his position (of leading a fad diet)… but it is even more ironic that this role is being played by someone with such a serious illness, with such a conflicted attitude toward his own illness, and who projects his own experience (struggling to eat enough to feel energetic, etc.) onto people who do not share the digestive problems (malabsorption-of-nutrients, etc.) of Crohn's disease.</p>

    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">what you said you're sick and tired but<br />what was your symptoms what disease
diseases or diseases did you have back
then clinical teams main mind Crohn's
disease a lot of asthma breathing issues
insomnia depression I thought I lost in
you like medically I'm gonna talk about
senior right oh just a lot those basic
things I'm not saying this to gloat
another man's misfortune but I received
a piece of information today from a
medical student named Edwin someone who
was in school to eventually become a
doctor who pointed out the fact that has
been hidden in plain sight that
durianrider has a very serious medical
condition called Crohn's colitis also
know just as Crohn's disease I was
completely unaware of that fact and as
soon as this medical student pointed it
out to me suddenly so many things click
so many little pieces fit together why
this man would preach a diet based
around bananas bananas have a special
role for people who suffer with Crohn's
colitis why he would have a sort of
persecuted feeling in dealing with the
medical establishment I have known one
person with Crohn's colitis but that
that's typical and it's because in this
generation they often cope with you know
conflicting and contradictory and
ineffective treatments being offered by
doctors because the disease has not been
well understood and within the last
twenty years different attempts at
treatment have failed but it is
basically a chronic incurable disease
with many ineffective treatments
also tragically you know when Crohn's
colitis flares up when it's in a really
bad state the the main form of treatment
is a steroid treatment not an anabolic
steroid but again this suddenly clicks
with so many aspects of during riders
online persona his advice his act his
obsessions I feel bad for the guy
III didn't know I didn't know this and
it suddenly makes all these other things
fit together but most fundamentally one
of the symptoms of Crohn's colitis that
never goes away doesn't matter if you
clean you've been cured by faith healing
by some miracle by praying to God's
ancient or modern Crohn's colitis one of
the symptoms is malabsorption of
nutrients your digestion does not work
the way a normal person's digestion
works because you've got Crohn's disease
and that is why typically if you've met
several people the condition people's
Crohn's disease even if they eat meat
even if they've done healthy diet they
are stereotypically very slender and
even somewhat frail looking they often
struggle to get enough nutrients so
suddenly all of the obsessive ranting
about eating and him his needing to eat
vastly more calories than a normal
person in order to feel energetic well
of course of course that's true if you
have caused disease but you should not
be giving diet advice to normal people
based on your needs as someone with a
chronic diagnosed health condition it's
not even a non diagnosed ill condition
so suddenly I mean all these things he
does have you know bananas and adding a
ton of sugar and saying that if he
doesn't eat that he'll feel lethargic
and so on anyway look I feel bad even in
saying it but in terms of the origins
and motivations for why this diet
developed in the way it did suddenly
have a reason for a man to want to
substitute bananas for most of the other
sources of nutrients in his diet
suddenly an explanation for why someone
would be so skinny and yet you know
packing in the carbs obsessively trying
to eat far more than regular people in
terms of carbohydrates and other
nutrients the people with Crohn's
disease chronically can't absorb the
obsessions about steroids above medical
treatments about doctors giving you
pills and things that don't work and his
clinging to the delusion that he's
healed this condition that he's cured
himself through his diet underneath all
the bragging all the bragging oshio you
know suddenly durian white his whole act
seems in a word pathetic boy but this is
just another reason why someone with no
medical expertise should not be putting
themselves in the position of a diet
guru that's why you should not simply
take yourself as an example for others
to imitate and emulate in the past have
said the reason why his diet doesn't
work for others is because other people
have a desk job they don't burn nearly
so many calories they're not riding a
bike in the tropics etc etc those role
fair and reasonable observations on my
part but Wow the asymmetry becomes even
more extreme if you're talking about a
long-distance athlete living in the
tropics etc etc who is also suffering
from a chronic disease like Crohn's
colitis that among its myriad symptoms
includes poor absorption of nutrients
Wow</div>
