    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">but overall<br />uh
i've made a change in my viewpoint
regarding veganism hands down um i
support the vegan diet i support a
vegetarian diet
i'm not against these things like i used
to be this idea this excuse this is how
i view it this black and white extremism
this militanism that you have to be
vegan and if you're not vegan you cannot
and you will never care about animals is
just simply just not true i love my cat
i love my dog but you know in another
part of the world they consume
these pets that doesn't make it okay
trust me i'm all against um people you
know eating cats and dogs if i have the
chance to try a product that is
non-animal related that doesn't use
animal products i will absolutely jump
at the opportunity to try it in fact in
my refrigerator right now i have oat
milk milk oatley i think it's the brand
oatley i have oatly ice cream it's
actually ice cream's amazing and that's
vegan there are some really good vegan
products out there and i'm being as
fully transparent as possible i don't
want to dedicate the time to having to
look at everything that i buy going the
extra effort on everything like i'm
doing welding i'm exhausted constantly
i'm in 110 degrees
cement cubicle i want to eat food that's
gonna fill me i just don't i'm lazy
that's what ultimately boils down to i
am lazy
uh that's why i don't wanna go vegan is
because i'm lazy and that's
[Music]
too much effort for me to do if you
wanna go vegan that's your personal
choice i will support you as long as
you're not hurting anybody personally i
don't really care what you do what you
ingest you know i go to a restaurant um
i've actually been to a couple of vegan
restaurants but if i go to a restaurant
a lot and they have vegan options i'm
gonna dab at some point i'm gonna try
that because i love to see what options
are out there
to not consume animal products if i have
the chance to do so i definitely will
but it's not a way that i want to live
my life and it's not really anybody's
business if i consume animal products
what does it mean to say
this is a private matter
this is a personal decision
i went vegan for like once i think one
one or two months and it was it was hard
um it's doable but i just
i don't want to be vegan it's just that
simple it's not something that i will
enjoy doing and
i do enjoy eating a nice steak every
once in a while and i don't think that
you should be angry or upset at people
who do eat steak every once in a while
because again it's none of your business
what people do with their own body if
they want to consume meat that's their
business are you really saying
it's my decision alone
how dare you question me are you really
leaning on what's ultimately a notion of
religious
tolerance
that this is my
private faith
how dare you question it how dare you
challenge it this kid repsian he got
famous in the first place
as an internet atheist as an advocate
for atheism and telling his own sad
story about being raised in a religious
household and rebelling against it
you know the challenge we're into here
is pressing beyond the limits
of a religious way of thinking
about values and concepts in our culture
that are not normally put in the same
category
as religion mind your own business
today
american currency says
in god we trust look into the history of
the american dollar bill look into the
history of the very first coins that
were minted in the united states of
america and you will find that the
slogan on them the slogan on some of the
very first coins that ever existed in
the american empire is
mind your
business
some of these ideas
whether it be
the right to bear arms
concepts of freedom
personal responsibility bedrock ethical
notions
in the american
and english-speaking
world okay
they rule over us
they shape our behavior
just as profoundly as a formally
organized religion and it can be much
more difficult
to get people to question the concepts
that they've received in an unexamined
way from the american constitutional
tradition from so-called secular
american culture can be much more
difficult
than getting them to question
prayer
circumcision
whether or not they personally
should remain celibate
until marriage questioning the concept
of god and the implications of god what
god means in their lives it's quite easy
to get people to do
questioning privacy
personal responsibility
in what ways
it would or would not be appropriate for
one person to confront another
about an ethical commitment like
veganism
about their diet about their drug habit
about the choices they're making they're
gonna have tremendous consequences for
their own lives for the lives of others
around them and sure
ecological consequences whether it be
for
animals or the environment thought of as
a kind of abstract system i had a
professor here at the university of
victoria
she's now retired she was about 65 years
old the time i had this conversation and
um
she had she had a double chin she was so
far overweight i've got to tell you she
really had no chin at all and uh she
told me she complained to me that she
was at that stage of life where it was
very difficult for her to buy clothes
she had to go to a special store to buy
clothes for overweight women and this
this kind of thing so she was at that
point of obesity when especially as you
get older in life you know the negative
consequences of that choice start to
really catch up with you and i say to
you honestly today
i don't know if she's still alive would
not surprise me at all
if
soon after having this conversation
she'd been in and out of hospital with a
heart attack or high blood pressure
problems or any other chronic ailments
that come along with those uh
those lifestyle choices which again for
the people making them they may not
perceive it as a choice at all they may
not think they're making a decision just
in the same way that being born into a
christian household and carrying on
christian traditions you may feel like
you're not making a decision at all you
didn't convert you didn't choose your
religion your religion chose you
and none of us signed up for these other
these other cultural values
none of us really thought through
the meaning of privacy of minding your
own business and none of us thought
through the morality of going around and
truthfully policing others and saying
how dare you
why don't you mind your own business how
dare you question me how dare you
question him how do you question her how
dare you call into question
the ethical choices
each of us are making in our lives we
didn't
we didn't choose that we didn't convert
to that right
you have to press further you have to
press past
the critique of religion to deal with
all of these values all of these
assumptions all of these beliefs
that delimit your thinking and guide
your action
in adult life anyway this this
particular professor she um said to me
i would say laughingly but perhaps
scoffingly would be better if it's a
word
she said to me scoffingly that um
as soon as i relocated to china as soon
as i started living and working in china
my commitment to veganism would just
disappear
that i would go back to eating meat or
eating cheese eggs or what have you
like all the other students like all the
other students she had who started
learning chinese and then
went around the world to
to live in china
and i fixed her with a glare
and i asked her
do you think that i'm weak
she was shocked she really she just
didn't see that coming i said do you
think that i'm a weak person
do you think that i'm an undisciplined
weak-willed person is that what you
think of me and i i think she just
repeated back something about how all
the other students who had gone to china
had lost the will or lost their nerve to
to be vegan
and um
i said maybe they were weak
maybe they were stupid
but not me
that's not who i am
i have a friend
and she had a very close relationship
with one of her professors over many
years
they were professor and student but they
were also
colleagues
that professor
he looks like he could collapse and die
anytime i've never met him i've only
seen photographs in terms of his level
of obesity in terms of consequences of
his health choices and i don't know to
what extent
cigarettes and alcohol are responsible
for that but he's grotesquely
overweight
grotesque is the word
how dare you
it's none of your business
it's his choice
freedom
life liberty and the pursuit of
happiness who are any of us to question
anyone else's choices you know this this
friend of mine
she had this friendship with a
professional one for many many years
and one day she just really drew the
line with them and said look you know
how how can we really be friends
if i'm vegan
and you're not it's her story to tell so
i'm not going to tell it
but it's very interesting example
where two people who knew and respected
each other intellectually
at some point there's a breakdown where
you say look if i'm really gonna be
honest with you
this ethical division between us it's
not okay and it's it's never going to be
okay you know i don't know if she would
have used these words but she was
basically saying i look you know
i know what you say in your lectures i
know your philosophy you know i know
what it is you preach and i know that
you don't practice it so to me
you're a hypocrite in my eyes
you're a hypocrite and there's really
just a fundamental practical sense in
which they couldn't be friends and they
couldn't be colleagues anymore now as
far as i know that's the end of the
story
maybe five years later
this older
obese professor is gonna change his mind
change his life
commit to a vegan diet maybe
and maybe five years from now he'll die
i don't want to dedicate the time to
having to look at everything that i buy
going the extra effort on everything
like truly living a life of not using or
consuming a singular
animal product that is used in anything
in your day-to-day life is practically
impossible i'm lazy that's what
ultimately boils down to i am lazy
uh that's why i don't want to go vegan
is because i'm lazy i don't drink
alcohol
my girlfriend melissa doesn't drink
alcohol do you have any idea
how many people
take the time to tell us that really we
should drink alcohol
it never occurs to anyone think
oh that's none of my business that's a
private matter that's up for you to
decide if you don't want to drink
alcohol you you do you
no
this is the first thing and the last
thing americans think of when something
like veganism comes up right oh it's
private it's a personal matter
how dare anyone ask how dare one person
tell another
what the correct answer is to this
question
it's personal
it's private shouldn't even think about
it
none of us
hesitate
to use peer pressure on one another
whether it's about drinking alcohol
watching sports on tv playing video
games going skiing the most trivial
self-indulgences imaginable right we all
engage in lobbying one another
to be lazier to be stupider to be more
self-indulgent to be more of a scumbag
and if you do anything
abnormal that's
good that other people can recognize as
positive
they're so eager to discourage you
they're so eager to shut you down
in this culture
we pretend
that there is this fence
separating each individual from every
other
and you can look over the fence but you
can't reach you can't touch you can't
talk you can't comment you can't say a
word
each of us in our own little backyard
is engaged in the pursuit of happiness
the reality is
people do not hesitate to bully you
people do not hesitate to police you
whenever you're doing something positive
in your life whenever you're doing
something that's extraordinary whenever
you're doing something that's above and
beyond
the bare minimum of leading a totally
self-centered self-indulgent lifestyle
people are so eager
to encourage you to get back in that
category of what they think of
culturally as normal oh you don't drink
alcohol oh you really should
nobody has this nobody thinks oh it's
none of my business oh who am i to judge
who am i to tell you oh no no no no if
you live in a state of sobriety my
girlfriend and i both do neither one of
us drank alcohol for many years oh no no
no the social pressure
for you to drink alcohol that's
tremendous and that's shameless
if you're vegan
and you encourage other people to be oh
you should be ashamed of yourself
right you're crossing the line
you're reaching over that
fence
mustn't do it's none of your business
what people do with their own body if
they want to consume meat that's their
business i'm someone who's very well
read in ancient greece in ancient rome
it comes up all the time
not that it's my own area of expertise
but if you care about history if you
care about politics if you care about
the constitution the united states of
america you've got to be able to make
shrewd comparative analytical statements
about
frankly how an historical figure like
aristotle is connected to the concepts
used by an historical figure like bill
clinton and when i got together with my
girlfriend a lot of people noticed that
she really stepped up the level of
effort she was putting into reading on
many different topics but this is one of
them she started becoming a
well-educated well-read person
in ancient greece
and atrium do you have any idea
how many people stepped up
and stepped out of the shatters to tell
her that she should not do that
or even to take a further step of trying
to claim that her boyfriend me that i'm
a bad influence on her
that somehow this is like an
unreasonable oppressive expectation that
her boyfriend is pretty like oh why are
you making the effort to read these
books from ancient greece and interim
why are you making the effort to improve
yourself why are you making the effort
to learn
there are people in different walks of
life
in this audience and some of you will
have felt this where it's pressure
not to be a stand-up comedian or not to
be an artist or not to sing when i did
humanitarian work in cambodia oh no
don't do humanitarian work in cambodia
the the peer pressure to be normal for
people who want to drag you down
to their level everyone's so eager to
police you if they're shepherding you
back into that category of normal oh you
don't watch sports oh you don't drink
alcohol oh you don't play video games
you should be normal you should be like
us
you should respond to our peer pressure
right to never reach above and beyond
your station to never be extraordinary
to never even attempt to do something
positive
they want to validate and vindicate
their own laziness
their own self-centered self-indulgence
the fact that they don't have any better
ambitions now and they never did they
want to validate that and vindicate that
by putting peer pressure on you
we all put pressure on one another all
the time
you know whether that's pressure to
smoke marijuana drink alcohol gamble you
know this this kind of peer pressure
right or i mean in this
relationship i think you know invisibly
i put pressure on my girlfriend to go to
the gym and she puts pressure on me
to go to the gym there are times when
she's going to the gym more than i do
and there's times when i'm going to the
gym more than she does in terms of
studying languages if you're in a
relationship one person is putting the
time to learn chinese and you're not
you're slacking off you know you you
feel
the pressure all the time
right
and it can be positive it can be
positive pressure it can be a wonderful
thing in your life like hey i'm in a
relationship with someone who wakes up
in the morning and hits the books and
studies chinese and she doesn't say a
word to me if i'm not if i'm not doing
that if i'm if i'm getting nothing done
or i'm spending my time on snake trivial
right i feel the difference i see the
difference i know the difference if
you're in a relationship with someone
who's waking up and going to the gym
every day it doesn't have to be in the
morning
whatever you know what they're doing and
you feel
where you are in your level of effort
you know relative to that okay i don't
give a [ __ ] if you feel oppressed by it
or not oh oh
but it's a private matter it's a
personal decision mind your own business
the fact
that it's a personal decision
does not mean
that there is no difference between
right and wrong
i wish i could reach out to that same
university professor today
and save her life
and change her life for the better over
the next 20 years
it is
her personal decision
and she is making the wrong
one there's a big difference between
dying at 65 and dying at 85.
there's a big difference between someone
at 65 who can barely walk up a flight of
stairs and has to buy clothes from a
special shop someone who's mentally
sharp alert productive
what does it mean
if you say that you believe in privacy
that you believe in personal choice
is that really so different from saying
that you don't care if someone else
makes the wrong decision
you don't care
if they live or die
repcion
if you're watching this i know
you have a history with drug addiction i
know you've struggled with relapses with
being in and out of therapy for it
drug addiction
is a personal choice
whether or not you get high
it's a private matter
it's up to you
that doesn't mean there's no difference
between making the wrong choice
and making the right one and that
doesn't mean it's morally wrong for
someone to break that invidious silence
of the isolated pursuit of happiness
to reach across the fence and say to you
that they care
they don't just care if you live or die
they care if you're leading a meaningful
life or a meaningless one and they want
to put peer pressure on you positively
not to be a drunk not to be a gambler
not to be a degenerate frankly they want
to put pure pressure on you
to make the right decision
and lead a better life</div>
