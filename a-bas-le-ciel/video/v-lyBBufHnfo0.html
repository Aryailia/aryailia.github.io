    <p>Yes, I remember G-Unit radio.  How soon we forget… 50 Cent and other rappers paved the way to the Whitehouse for Donald Trump over many, many years.  I suppose I'm glad to see that the level of vulgarity in mainstream politics is now so high that my own use of coarse language seems negligible.  Maybe I can put together a mixtape and run for mayor of Podunk after all.</p>
