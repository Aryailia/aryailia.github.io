    <h1>Buddhism, when "Interpretation" Means Fiction</h1>
    <p>24 February 2014 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeXTk52LAfg">[link youtube]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Some comments and examples following up on my earlier video "Reading Mythology but Seeing History". In modern Buddhism, to a shocking extent, "interpretation" has become a genre of fiction.</p>

    <div class="transcription">that we had to reinterpret the Christian Bible<br />you start with the premise that Jesus knew

well, that wouldn't really entail a "reinterpretation"
that would entail a rewriting of it
or that you just ask people to ignore things
on the grounds that "Well, Jesus couldn't
going to have to close your eyes to."
but that would be shockingly simplistic, or
and I don't think Christians really even do

no sense of irony,
"...therefore, it's impossible that he believed
in the ancient writings, we, basically, should

following up on an article I'd published
development of the fetus in the ancient writings,
those texts show an ancient world-view, they're
unlike Christians or Muslims, Buddhists don't
they're written down by human beings,
to believe that there's scientific accuracy
[the texts] reflect what ancient people thought
that, no, my interpretation of the text must
that it "logically" must be wrong,
scientific notion of how pregnancy, gestation
it's so sad, it's so pathetic,
invisible.
business of imposing modern expectations on
of thinking "this must live up to this expectation",

or to reflect some other virtue, or reflect

without mentioning hell,

when they sit down next to you at an academic
and tell you that they are "interpreting"
omniscient
that happened 2,000 years earlier
it seriously when people tell you their supposedly

in Buddhism,
sadly, what we're talking about isn't interpretation</div>
