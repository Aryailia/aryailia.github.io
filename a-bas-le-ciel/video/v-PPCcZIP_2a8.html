you need to see me do  you need to see the bell [ __ ] bar is  standing beside her holy [ __ ] man my  name is built by the stand-up comedian  let us sing a [ __ ] song holy [ __ ]  this nihilism  runs  thief  and it conveys  uh it conveys and betrays  a certain contempt  for the meaning and importance of our  work here  that what we do so long as we claim that  it is a joke doesn't matter  that what we say here doesn't matter  that our actions every day as elected  leaders in the united states of america  doesn't matter  that this chamber and what happens in it  doesn't matter  and i am here to rise to say that it  does  our work here matters  our example  matters  there is meaning  in our service  and as leaders  in this country  when we incite violence  with depictions against our colleagues  that trickles down into violence in this  country  and that is where we must draw the line  independent of party identity or belief  it is about a core recognition of human  dignity and value and work  so when we talk about as mentioned in  the resolution  that these depictions  are part of a larger trend  of misogyny  and racial  racism  this has resulted in  dampening participation  and so this vote is not as complex  as perhaps the republican leader would  like to  make jokes uh believe  it's pretty it's pretty cut  do you find does anyone in this chamber  find this behavior acceptable  would you allow depictions of violence  against women against colleagues  would you would you allow that in your  home  do you think this should happen on a  school board  [Music]  in a city council  in a church  and if it's not acceptable there why  should it be accepted here  lastly  when the republican leader rose to talk  about how there are all of these double  standards and lists of litanies of all  these different things  not once  did he list an example of a member of  congress threatening the life of another  this is not about a double standard and  what is unprecedented  and what's tragic is the descent  of transgression in this body  i grew up as a little girl  with awe  about our nation's capital  the reverence and the importance and the  gravity of our work here  additional 30 seconds  recognized the gravity of our work here  so ma the question that i pose to this  body in response  is will we live up to the promises that  we make our children  that this is a place where we will  defend one another regardless of belief  that our core human dignity matters  [Music]  now this nihilism  runs  deep  and it conveys  uh it conveys and betrays  a certain contempt  [Music]</div>
