    <hr>
    <p>"...we tend to let ourselves imagine that a skeptical reading of mythology reveals something other than a myth... conversely, one interesting side-effect of this attitude toward mythology, is that we're always producing new mythology, through new interpretations that fasten onto one aspect or another of the story as 'real' and 'original'..."<br><br><br><br>This subject here is hard to guess from the title: "Atheism and Apotheosis: Regarding Religion as History".  The video can serve as either an intro or an outro for the other skeptical discussions of the history of Buddhism on this channel; it does wrap up several of the recurring themes and questions.</p>
