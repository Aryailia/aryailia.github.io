    <p>Please turn on the SUBTITLES (字幕) for this one: the sound quality is poor, but I prefer to share this video than to record another, less-spontaneous version ("take two").<br><br><br><br>Thanks to Theo for typing out the subtitles.  You can check out his (vegan-politics-and-youtube-related) website, here:<br><br>activistjourneys.wordpress.com/eisel-mazard<br><br><br><br>From my perspective, this video discusses an important set of issues within veganism, and clearly shows the contrast between ideological and nihilistic thinking, the contrast between utopian and empirical thinking, and so on, with conclusions that link my current perspective on vegan politics to my past work on Buddhist politics and Communism (HINT: I'm Anti-Communist).</p>
