    <p>The title sums it up: Styles P is Vegan (Elon Musk is NOT, Sam Harris is NOT, Richard Dawkins is NOT).  LINKS TO SOURCES mentioned in the video below:<br><br>(1) Sam Harris admitting that meat-eating is immoral, but saying that he just couldn't manage to be vegetarian (let alone vegan): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLFnJ8pWh8g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLFnJ8pWh8g</a><br><br>(2) On Richard Dawkins NOT being vegan, quotations and further links: <a href="http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.ca/2014/05/richard-dawkins-eats-meat-and-makes-excuses-for-it.html">http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.ca/2014/05/richard-dawkins-eats-meat-and-makes-excuses-for-it.html</a><br><br>(3) Video of Elon Musk admitting that he tried being vegetarian, but just "couldn't do it", in response to a question from a vegan child (who hints at the ecological significance of the choice), apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/Qi1_gtwWZuM?t=25m18s">https://youtu.be/Qi1_gtwWZuM?t=25m18s</a><br><br>(4) Styles P talking about his past "legal troubles": www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGy8YijzRes</p>
