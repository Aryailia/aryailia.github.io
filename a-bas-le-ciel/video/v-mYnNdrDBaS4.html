    <h1>Vegans, Leaders & Followers (Freelee, Durianrider, Gary Yourofsky & Ecology)</h1>
    <p>07 July 2015 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYnNdrDBaS4">[link youtube]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Leadership is created by followership: vegans tends to select certain types of charismatic leaders, in the absence of any "institutional" structure for their ecological and ethical interests (that could have, hypothetically, been shaped by the Green Party, Greenpeace or other institutions, that have thus far failed to take on any such leadership role).  This video raises broad questions of who our leaders are (how and why we select them), examining the type of leadership that results from internet-centered activism in the 21st century.</p>
