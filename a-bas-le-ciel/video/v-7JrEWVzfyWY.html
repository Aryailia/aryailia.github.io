    <hr>
    <p>14 hours on a train; 4 minutes on video-tape.  And, yeah, if you're vegan: pack food.  They've got a specialized foie-gras restaurant at Paris's main train station, but you ain't gonna find a damn thing to eat: this is a country where they even put cheese in sushi.  I wish I was joking: I've now seen "vegetarian sushi" that has CHEESE in it.<br><br><br><br>And, once again, shout out to Lil B. #TYBG</p>

Europe looks like in order to see my

transportation in each direction the
traveling from where I live in the west
coast of Canada to Germany was
horrendous and then the trip I had to
make from Germany to the Cote d'Azur of
the South of France is also pretty
horrendous 14 hours in transport heat
with it's just 14 hours on the train and
at the train station really tough and
the bottom line is thousands of dollars
spent on lawyers thousands of dollars
spent on transportation 17 days in
Europe not cheap spending money I don't
have and in the end I was only able to
spend two hours with my daughter but I
did it because it was the right thing
