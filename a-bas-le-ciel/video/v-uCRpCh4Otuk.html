    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">it could be complained that i have not  had a lot of stability in my life and it  could be celebrated that i've had a lot  of spontaneity in my life  i saw a youtube video yesterday almost  at random almost you can probably  imagine  what i've clicked on in the last month  that would have led youtube to recommend  this video to me but i saw a youtube  video from a white guy who had been  living and teaching english in japan for  many years and eventually he got fed up  and quit and moved elsewhere but he was  talking about what he disliked about  life in japan he talked about the  monotony he talked about the  predictability of life he talked about  the lack of imagination and spontaneity  and ambition amongst the people and he  really specified that he felt he was  having exactly the same conversation  with people again and again that he  could predict exactly what people were  going to say his life was that  predictable was that monotonous and the  people who surrounded him were all  dreadful conformists with no imagination  now you might say this gives a man  something to rebel against in his life  give you something  give something to brace yourself against  when exercising your own creativity your  own spontaneity or finding your own your  own ambitions and of course some people  never do  um  you know  the life i've led including even just in  the last two years  within the last  five years within the last 10 years in  the last 20 years right there's been no  stability there's no stability in terms  of my own day-to-day life what i'm doing  right now there's been no stability in  the expectation of what i'm gonna do  in the next few years right the my plans  for the future my career plans my plans  even for what i'm doing on this youtube  channel are subject to so much change  like from day to day from week to week  and so on uh you know i've been living a  life that  in subtle ways it's just totally  different from the middle aged north  american norm it's certainly very  different from the the middle aged  japanese norm i've never had that kind  of  a sense of dreadful monotony and  regularity to rebel against now  i made a video more than a year ago  criticizing the concept of nostalgia  and guys today this is an open q a we  can actually talk about today whatever  you want to talk about i don't say that  like  most of my videos most of my live  streams i say look there's one topic  this is all we're going to discuss so if  you ask a perfectly good question an  unrelated topic i'm not going to die but  not today i'm really i'm really open  this way  uh i've criticized nostalgia  from many different angles and many  different aspects but it's been spread  out over the years this huge channel  it's something that's only come up a few  times  you know what i'd like to point out in  opening this video is this  i think for a lot of people  the period of their childhood  possibly the period of their teenage  years  that was the period  in which they had spontaneity  that was the period in which they had  ambition or which they could have  ambition they could be anything they  wanted to be they could become a police  officer they could become a fireman you  know like there was this this  possibility this was the period of their  life in which what they were doing on  any given day  was not so dreadfully predictable and in  which their idea of the future their  idea of what they're doing next week  next month next year next decade was not  so dreadfully predictable and then they  lost that  right so the yearning for their youth  the yearning again for some people maybe  their teenage years for some people  maybe when they were 11 years old what  it is they fasten on to and have the  sense of nostalgia or interestingly that  also differs between people for some  people it's as late as their university  years i think that's actually relatively  rare for people to yearn to want to go  back to say age 20 or 21 or something  but maybe maybe for for some it is right  there's a lot of discussion of the  consumerist aspects of nostalgia of  wanting to own  and touch and hold things again that you  owned as a child so yeah and fair enough  and we can talk about that today and we  can talk about something  totally different you know  but  what about  the lost sense of your own potential  the last sense that there was another  person you could be or simply that there  were many possibilities  of the person you could become you know  the sense that you uh in who you were  and what you did were something  malleable  um something susceptible to  improvement and even to improvisation  that you were a  spontaneous  changing  you know  desiring a hearing character instead  of being someone who at whatever age  someone who had made your compromises  who had made your commitments in life  and for whom now  nothing new and nothing different is  possible you know now i guys as you can  imagine i'm not uh  glamorizing or glorifying this  you know this this side of it is quite  hard for me to sympathize with frankly  uh i've said this before i try to be sex  positive i try  it's very hard to be sex positive in the  21st century it's very easy to be sex  negative i remember a friend of mine  we were good friends at the time but we  now now haven't spoken for many years we  were two people we were good friends for  a short time like maybe for one year we  were friends this me and this guy but  you can guess from this story it's not a  story he would tell anyone  he had become an english teacher when he  was quite a young man so you know being  an esl teacher you can do it as soon as  you finish your bachelor's degree and  that was what he that was what he did he  finished his ba and he went to teach  english i don't know  if he was 22 or something when this  story happened he had just finished  university and he didn't go to teach  english in japan he went to italy  it's easy to forget this but um  you can be an exotic foreigner in italy  too you can be a red-haired person or  something in italy and you get a male or  female you get a lot of attention you  know yes you might be exotic if you went  to japan but you were exotic even within  italy so he was a kind of exotic young  man  uh in in italy  and he described this middle-aged  married woman  who paid  for him to come to her home  and tutor her  one-on-one in english and her at first  subtle  and later blatant attempts to seduce him  into  bed  look okay  [Laughter]  we certainly live in a culture in which  it's regarded as harmless for people to  want to recapture their youth whether  that's recapturing the spirit of their  youth whether that's through consumer  activity whether that's through going to  the gym whether that's through a new  diet you know diet exercise personal  transformation new haircut new hair dye  new uh  red press-on nails new fingernails new  you right  and and note that  newness  what is newness associated with  youth nostalgia a return to childhood a  return to your teenage years why  whatever being a new old man what i  would have a new gray beard i want to  have a new perspective on life that's  mature and elderly and philosophically  no no no don't be a new socrates don't  be a new  don't be a new aristotle or something no  no the new you is a younger version of  you right there can be no doubt that for  both men and women in our century in our  culture  um  one of the forms of nostalgia  is going out and seducing and sleeping  with a younger person right now again  actually i think you could  you could digress into a set of  reflections and how this is different in  the culture of japan  than it is in the culture of say taiwan  of communist china of western europe of  north america and how also this is  regarded and judged  in each of these places and how i mean  i've started with example of an older  woman and a younger man i think it's  actually regarded today it's it's about  equally as negative for both genders i  think so you think about a 50 year old  woman with a  22 year old man let's just say that  think about a 50 year old man and a 22  year old woman  both  you know regarded with the same kind of  uh disdain  just once i remember uh going out for  lunch with my mother  and so this is i i looked older than i  was i'm i honestly don't know if i was  19 at the time but people probably  people probably thought i was 25 but  once i remember i met my mother for  lunch and i was well dressed  and the waiter he not only treated me as  as as a man on a date throughout the  thing he brought me the bill at the end  i remember  laughing about my mother said well you  know you know mom you're not doing that  bad you know  if you're if you think you're youthful  good luck that they think we're here as  a couple and not as mother and son like  you know this is the way the waiters and  that that restaurant it must have  happened often enough that there were  women in their 50s with young men in  their in their 20s or something you know  to me it seemed preposterous but these  things exist and they exist often enough  that the waiter he was trying to be  polite he was presenting me with the  bill as if i was the one who was going  to pay for the trusty look yes just  against a couple you know it was i i  didn't say a word a complaint to the  waiter i just laughed about it with my  mother so those things are regarded as  ods they happen on a massive scale  anyway  collecting  batman figurines as a as a as a  middle-aged man it is regarded as odious  right now look on youtube how many  youtube channels does the guy have his  collection of figurines in the  background i'm saying batman of course  it could be spider-man it could be  dragon ball z  it could be any anime crap you know of  course you know um being a middle-aged  man with a collection of full-size  arcade cabinets these are video games on  a big scale i can't count how many  youtube channels the guys film with that  in the background i used to have my  books in the background and people  ridiculed me for it and and by the way  it wasn't a collection of books they  were the books i was reading that week  they were my current  books i was really working on that week  that month kind of thing you know i by  the way i can go back to doing that  again i don't i don't mind i'm not shy a  lot of you guys know what i'm reading i  got a request from the audience recently  to let them know what i'm reading in  advance so when i do book review videos  people have the chance to respect which  i can do i said also i said oh i could i  could list what melissa's reading in  advance if and when melissa is reading  something different myself sometimes  we're working the same book but anyway i  digress there is there is stigma you  know there is a social stigma there is  uh the perception  that this is something you should be  ashamed of um  these various forms of nostalgia however  they are nevertheless  massively popular  you know social and cultural events in  our time to say they're scarce or rare  or unusual is ridiculous my point being  the stigma exists it is not sufficient  to deter or diminish the popularity of  these things so you know look um  what are people  yearning for in any of these uh  scenarios  you know okay it's easy to say sex is  just sex it's easy to say  amassing material possessions is just  amassing material possessions whether  it's buying figurines or buying uh comic  books or or what have you well you know  i've got to tell you something  in terms of my own toxic masculinity  i don't think sex ever is just sex i  think sex even for homosexual people  even for transgender people even for  hashtag child free people people who  made up their mind they never want to  have children i think sex really is  about reproduction of the species i  think sex really is about creating and  sustaining the social bonds that make it  possible to raise children so the point  being it's not just to get someone  pregnant and have a kid but to have the  kind of relationship with a woman or  with a number of women or with a woman  and a gay man or a transgender person  and a man and whatever your  your clan or your community or your  tribe is made up of because in  historical time let alone evolutionary  time it wasn't the case that one man and  one woman raised the child together  talking about at least four people  working together closely to raise a  child and i've seen those conditions  where i was in uh where i was in  southeast asia you know the mountains of  northern laos uh the adjacent mountains  of northeastern myanmar we had the last  peoples really living in traditional uh  travel conditions so i could list off  others also northeastern cambodia there  were few places like that where there  still were people living to say  traditional wasn't traditionally is an  understatement you know they're really  still living in kind of bronze age stone  age conditions of the mountains you know  it wasn't one man and one woman could  not raise a child that way sorry just  the actual manual labor of cooking and  cleaning and gathering food and building  and rebuilding your house constantly  sorry just interestingly you know we  think today in the modern world of  building a building a house is something  you do once in ancient times ancient  materials  or  you're  your house your house is biodegradable  okay you're  it's constant construction and work on  your  you know so yeah you need some kind of  tribe level set of relationships with  people you know i just say for me from  my toxic masculinity perspective sex is  never  just sex so if you're talking about a  50 year old man  pursuing a 20 year old  woman  what is it he wants what is it he's  after in many many of these cases look  i'm not gonna say this is a hundred  percent of cases in some cases the man  wants to have a baby and raise a child  don't get me wrong this exists i'm not  gonna say there are no 50 year old men  looking to settle down and have a child  with a 21 of course of course that he  says but on a massive scale and a mass  phenomenon and especially when we  include phenomena like simping  phenomena like only fans  sugar baby sugar daddy relationships and  by the way again japan  has its own rich vocabulary for all of  these relationships all these gray areas  of surrounding prostitution and and  thailand does also and china does also  like each one of these cultures you're  going to find a very different set of of  just terms and categories for what these  uh what these relationships are  here's here's a hilarious comment from  the audience so i thought this was  scientifically debunked so random dude  says quote at age 50 your sperm is as  healthy as tiki sam's body so that is  not to my knowledge friend dude that is  not true  that no a man especially if you're a man  who doesn't smoke cigarettes doesn't  drink alcohol eats a vegan diet etc that  sadly men and women are are unequal in  terms of uh  reproductive years  that there's basically a prejudice that  men's the quality of men's sperm  declines as they get older but  this is uh scientifically this does not  hold up anyway if you i mean i remember  when i lived in france everyone thought  i was like 15 years younger than i was  because people the men aged so badly  there the men aged the badly they all  smoked cigarettes they all drank alcohol  like you could make a list and sort of  in the french diet  you know what what yeah well you could  see it i always remember walked past  this one hamburger restaurant  so this wasn't mcdonald's but it was a  similar style of fast food restaurant  these big signs up special this month  a burger with pate de fuego  i think what should we just call this  fog this duck liver on a hamburger  that's what these people are eating so i  could go on and on about the french diet  you know they feed veal to babies like  the french aren't just non-vegan or  anti-vegan they're this unbelievably  unhealthy diet which includes by the way  raw meat uncooked meat and the diet and  then all the diseases go on anyway yeah  i remember i remember just really people  there perceiving me as like 15 years  younger than i was i was like  i don't think i'm very youthful looking  but it's true a lot of the men have  these kind of withered features and if  you live the wrong lifestyle  you know i get it oh by the way great so  again i did say this live stream i'm  actually happy to have you guys change  the topic or change the direction and to  do this as a q a but i do have some  things to say as you probably i do have  some opinions to share  but um great question from the audience  quote are you bisexual or gay so i'm  gonna tell you something this is from  someone called yzx  i don't know if i have ever met anyone  more heterosexual than myself  i have absolutely zero capacity for  bisexuality in me  zero  um  i have never found another man  attractive i've also never found them  repulsive you know i'm not saying this i  hate anybody but i've known guys and  they're really like they don't want to  be around other men when they're naked  and stuff and i think that's because  they feel both attraction and repulsion  like they feel some maybe repressed  bisexual aspect of their nature being  being activated that way because for me  a naked man it's like looking at a naked  wooden table like it's just it's just a  completely non-sexual object to me being  around other men is just not  i don't react to it in any way at all  so yeah you know um  [Music]  look i i've i have had gay male friends  i have had bisexual male friends  i have had a number of female friends  who were married to men who turned out  to be gay and i've told some anecdotes  about that on the youtube channel over  the years it's kind of been a recurring  thing and you know i talk a lot about  the importance about not being  uh  not being repressed or not being in the  closet if you're gay or bisexual and now  it really has negative  um  uh negative implications for for  yourself i mean it's it's very  psychologically damaging you know for  the individual person to repress and lie  about their own sexuality and live a lie  but it also has really negative  implications for other people  um so yeah i  that is also an interesting topic to me  so melissa i might have never told you  this  this might have come up a conversation  like five years ago one of my  girlfriends i'm not gonna say i'm not  gonna give any indication which  girlfriend is but one of my  ex-girlfriends in the past  her father  had been gay  uh and this is just  twenty percent clear he was a man who  had sex with men  right up until the minute when he got  her mother pregnant  and to my knowledge it was an accidental  unplanned pregnancy she was a gay man  who tried  and then he decided to kind of repackage  and rebrand himself as as straight and  try to live as a as a straight man  and  i got to see how that was going and how  it was falling apart  and one of his gay lovers from the past  was still friends with them  and there was this very interesting  drama playing out  uh i could tell all kinds of details but  i do i do remember all the details of  this but i remember that was one really  instructive example  i knew another family  um i wasn't really friends with these  people it's not worth i can't i also  want to keep this anonymous uh but it  was a fan where i knew the parents and  they had a daughter my own age  um  other people wanted me to have a  relationship with this daughter and it  was just ridiculous we had nothing  income there was no possibility of us  having relationship whatever was one of  those funny situations and i remember in  that case  even though the father of the family was  a full-time psychiatrist  i was his job as  he'd been a repressed homosexual his  whole life and during the time i knew  him and i knew the family he was  cracking he was breaking down right at  that time  it's a coincidence because i wasn't  involved with their lives for very long  and you know i i forget if they actually  got divorced but they got separated  certainly and he started getting drunk  at gay bars all the time  and i remember this is i mean it's part  the guy has a phd and you know connie  studied sigmund freud and all this stuff  all his life but he couldn't admit to  himself that he was gay he probably  counseled other people he probably had  other clients and things he talked to  about homosexuality and so on over the  years a lot but finally as really not  even a middle-aged man as an old man he  was admitting to himself he was he had  been gay  and i remember he um so i i don't know  how long this went on for  but he had this period where he refused  to take phone calls from anyone unless  he was at the gay bar i thought that was  so telling as a crutch that like having  having tried to insist that he was  heterosexual for so many years now and  you know like obviously you could hear  noise in the background  you know but like somehow this was like  a statement like no if you want to call  me if you want to talk to me i'll be at  the bar i'll be at this like he'd be at  this gay bar  uh doing call like he wouldn't take a  call from his own i forget if his  parents were dead uh probably you know  but he wouldn't take a call from  relatives or unless he was yeah at the  gate bar that was a really extreme woman  i um one of my other girlfriends it was  instead the mother  who had been a lesbian all her life  until this one unique relationship  happened in that case i don't  i don't think that pregnancy was  accidental but she had been a lesbian  she had kids with this one man and then  when that broke up and they got divorced  she went back to being a lesbian  so yeah it happens and um you know i'm  not i i really i have i have friends  right now i've known a number of  different women who were just my friends  um  who  ended up married to men who were more  gay than they thought they were more gay  that the women were left  so it's it's a huge phenomenon i mean  male bisexuality and male homosexuality  is a huge phenomenon and what percentage  of men  are  outright gay or partly gay  i think we'll never know it's a huge  percentage and interestingly the  percentage of women who are really  lesbian  i've looked at social science research  on this it really does seem to be much  smaller and there's no  as far as we know  this is just random or whatever there's  no there's no particular  uh reason for this  that's known at this time it's possible  in the future some reason we're going  for it obviously in the past people used  to theorize that when you were looking  at these statistics  stigma and repression you know the fact  that people were in the closet that this  was skewing the statistics but as time  goes on now to give an example if you're  looking at a society like the  netherlands  well do you really think homophobia in  the netherlands is so intense that  people are concealing you know in in  this context of a social science  survey or research project you know so  obviously it's saudi arabia  what percentage people saudi arabia are  okay it's probably impossible to do the  research possible now but when you're  looking at really liberal western  societies anyway sorry nice nice uh dead  question there but yeah you know guys um  i have very vivid dreams uh still to  this day it's come there have been  different periods of my life where it  came and went which has been discussed  in the channel if i just for whatever  reason or periods of my life where i  dream more or dreamless i have never  once had a homoerotic dream in my life  and it's just amazing because i dream so  much and that some some of my dreams are  are random and some of my some of my  dreams do uh tell you something about my  sexuality a lot of my dreams are  intellectual in character i mean again  another another topic talk about what it  is i dream about what is i'm thinking  about and talking about in my dreams um  but you know yes you know my my dreams  do reflect my my sexuality and have done  so you know my whole life you know  dreams also reflect your resentments and  your fears i do not think your dreams  present the best part for me i do not  think your dreams reflect depict or  indicate the best part of your character  but they reflect something about you you  know there's something shallow you can  see about yourself in your in your  dreams you know i always say it's like  you know if you're worried about  something like you're worried about  being unemployed and you have dreams  that reflect those worries and that  shallow way your dreams reflect what's  going on in your life but no i've i have  never  i've never had any  inclination or or openness or capacity  uh for bisexuality myself it is just  utterly not in me and i've had to talk  about that sometimes with with gay  people  because it's quite popular for gay  people to reassure themselves by by  saying that everyone is to some extent  gay or bisexual so i'm saying it's never  been an ugly or mean conversation like  no you know in the same way that  parents have to accept that their child  may be 100 gay like they may be not  bisexual like you know sometimes a son  or daughter has to say their parents  look it's it's not that they're open to  swinging with everyone like look you  need to know mom and dad they are just  going to be 100 with the same gender  forever well some of us i'm sorry but  we're also 100  uh  you know heterosexual and that has to be  accepted so sometimes as soon as that  comes up and we're interested i'll read  the other comments that have popped up  while i've been on this uh this peculiar  depression  so someone called rogem  so i i've never seen the name rogem  before so rogam i wonder if you're in  sri lanka because the name given is  rogam silva  obviously it could be a portuguese name  but that would be that looks more like a  name from sri lanka to me so shout out  shout out to my viewers in sri lanka  um  rogam says quote most men that i know  are into pretty young women for them  women at 40 years old are too old but  for me i've been into 45 plus year old  women since my teenage years so um look  it's just a totally different topic  uh  in various times in my life including  back when i was a scholar of buddhism i  knew women in their 40s who were still  really really good-looking  and that has everything to do with the  fact that they refuse to drink alcohol  you know it has everything to do with  the fact they didn't cigarettes didn't  drink alcohol didn't do drugs and that  they were  vegetarian i mean that at that time i'm  not thinking about women who are vegan  but obviously being vegetarian or vegan  is also a huge help  and i would just say that the  competitive dynamics of human sexuality  they become more intense  when you're talking about women in their  40s or men in their 40s um  the number of women who are still  attractive in their 40s is fewer and  fewer and the number of women who are  available who aren't already married or  what have you uh becomes fewer and fewer  so the inequalities that we grow  accustomed to in our teenage years or in  our early 20s  um you might think that we'll all become  more equal as the decades go on but on  the contrary i think the inequalities  get worse  and the women i've known who were still  attractive and even in their 30s frankly  30s or 40s you know and i think i think  this is true in their 50s too but the  women who still were attractive and who  in any way indicated that they were  single or available the kind of feeding  frenzy and competition that's there is  unbelievable and you know men are  honest or dishonest about it in their  own way after their own fashion but i  think i think for men you can just say  the same thing the vast majority of men  are not attractive anymore at 45 years  old and again alcohol has a lot to do  with it drug use like alcohol marijuana  cigarettes or even hard drugs also  dietary choices  but look you know sorry again  one digression leads to another so a  concept i put out in an earlier live  stream was the idea of the cultural  olympics cultural competition and the  cultural lottery  um  how many men are attractive culturally  or intellectually when they're 45 years  old if you're 45 and you've been sitting  on the couch watching sportscenter for  the last 35 years or something  you're 45 and you watch the super bowl  every year  you're 45 and you you know god i  remember seeing a documentary on the  news this is just a documentary segment  on the news about middle-aged men  who still collected  uh soccer stickers so you may know about  baseball cards right it's like baseball  cards but these are stickers you place  into books the same thing but they're  stickers you place in the book and who  every year buy the sticker album and  then buy these packs of stickers and you  try to collect them all they have every  player on every team and stick around  through these guys in their voice i'd  say you know what whatever i'm sure  i'm sure plenty of those guys found  women who love them or women who  tolerate them but yeah when you when you  add the intellectual and cultural  aspects then yeah you get more and more  competition focused around a smaller and  smaller number of nubile partners and i  say nubile being very well aware of the  bizarre etymology  of that word and how strange the the  meanings are because you can still be a  desirable uh partner at  but you know i know anyway these are the  these what can i say the wages of sin to  use an old and worn out phrase  uh quote gay people have children all  the time often they would tell their  partners in advance they only need a  short-term relationship for the purpose  of conceiving a baby it's normal in the  u.s so random dude in terms of an  argument about rights  like i don't disagree with the gay  people have the right to have children  this way  but if you say it happens all the time  i have background in political science i  have a background looking at social  science statistics  it's it's rare  like if you actually start to look at  the statistics  how many gay people so are we talking  about gay men to give you an example i  read an interview a long interview with  a man and he was the first gay man in  the history of the netherlands  to ever adopt a child  and he knew so obviously this this is  from several years ago he knew how many  gay men ever because the netherlands had  good statistics for this he knew the  exact number of gay men who had ever  adopted a child the number of gay men  who had ever been a single father  through one of these other relationships  like having a woman  bury your child and then you become the  sole parent or whatever you know and it  sorry he so when he did the interview he  seemed to know these numbers of  something it was incredibly few people  you know so it's easy to say that and  you know again if making an argument  about about rights like legal rights and  privileges it may be important to say  look gay men have the right to adopt a  child or gay men have the right to enter  into these things and i understand that  but  um what percentage of the population  actually does it and look guys um  melissa and i read a lot of literature  from ancient athens and ancient rome  the level of buggery in ancient athens  the level of uh flagrantly open  homosexuality and pederasty and really  scandalous gay sex in athens it's  unbelievable it seemed like it seems  like the majority of men in ancient  athens were gay not not the minority but  the majority and then you have a  question well is this are these cultural  factors is this just exaggerated in the  literature is it the case that the kind  of person who wrote philosophy  that those guys were majority gay the  type of people who wrote for the theater  also because a lot of we have our  playable maybe the majority of people in  the theater were gay but not the  majority of people in society you know  is it really possible that such a huge  percentage of people in ancient athens  were gay but  uh if you want to ask questions how many  people in ancient athens were gay  but were adopting and raising children  or something you know  where's the evidence for that now again  i'm not saying zero did  but to depict that as a normal  widespread common phenomenon it's not  it's not criticism but i mean if you  look into it for any of these societies  how common is it really for gay partners  to raise kids i totally understand why  for for  you know uh  political reasons you insist on it being  normal and natural and being a right  you're entitled to but it remains a very  very marginal phenomenon and just being  real with you i think if you start going  to gay clubs and gay events or gay  political conferences that's a good  example how many of the gay people at a  political conference you know where  gabriel how many of them are actively  raising children and how many of them  ever will um  it's not zero but yeah this is a this is  quite a marginal phenomenon  so uh someone who knows statistics for  germany says that lgbt in germany is 7.4  and it is one of the most uh liberal  societies with the highest percentages  so uh this is a regular viewer do you  want to give me a kiss comments so he or  she uh prophesies that that probably the  natural rate of homosexuality would not  be more than 10  so this is the thing so  to me this is fascinating if it's not  fascinating to you i apologize what's  interesting about measuring  homosexuality is that you have to do  full life cycle analysis right  so frankly uh someone like amber heard  is a good example  um immediately before she married johnny  depp she was in a relationship with a  woman she was in a  lesbian relationship gay relationship  whatever you wanna you wanna say  if you just conduct social science  research as a snapshot in one moment in  time  you will record a certain number of  teenage girls who say they are lesbian  because they're currently in a lesbian  relationship we saw a vegan channel  right that was reflecting this remember  there was this woman uh she was british  and she she made a video basically  apologizing to her audience because she  had made so many videos talking about  being a lesbian over years  and then at the end she discovered or  admitted to herself that she wasn't a  lesbian at all that she was really  heterosexual when she's in a  heterosexual issue and she doesn't she  doesn't just mean that she's bisexual  and happens to like this guy especially  she really had to break down and  recognize that she had been lying to  herself she told herself she was loving  she came on youtube and talked about  being a lesbian for years  and then she discovered uh she was  straight now i earlier in this video if  you weren't here i was talking about  examples of gay men who get married to  women and after many years admit to  themselves that they're really gay they  were professional sexually so obviously  it can happen both ways but the point is  if you really want to talk about  de facto  heterosexuality homosexuality and  bisexuality you have to have interviews  with people where you're  retrospectively looking back at their  track record over 10 20 30 years of  their life i mean ideally you'd just  interview people when they're 60 or 65  or something 60 70 80 when they're  toward the end of their life and then  talk about who the partners were they  had during their their sexually active  years no offense i mean whatever  presumably they've settled down in their  80s or whatever when you do this and you  will then get a very different picture  especially of bisexuality if what you're  trying to measure is the rate of of  bisexuality but um the idea  that during high school you figure out  if you're gay or straight and then you  stick with the viewers your life  it's understandable why people presume  that's something you can easily  ascertain through through a poll um  human sexuality does not work that way  now i say this um  i have the  toxic masculinity privilege let's say  this sitting here i i'm a completely  heterosexual person with absolutely no  ambiguity and i never had any ambiguity  and  so you know i'm not saying nobody knows  in their teenage years and obviously i  knew people who figured they were gay  during their teenage years too so you  know whether you figure out that you're  gay or straight some people do but  significant numbers of people do not you  know  oh great question why are you against  downhill skiing  so the full the question in full reads  quote why are you against downhill  skiing you've mentioned it a few times  do you dislike gravity in general  so  do you give me lucas following up with  my comment about collecting uh soccer  stickers so in europe these football  stickers equivalent to baseball cards  quote typically the soccer sticker hype  comes around with every world cup  that's right but there's always another  i mean because there's money made in  this so there's the world cup and then  there's the  this cup and the that cup i mean you  know there's always another cup you're  right the world cup is maybe the most  famous but there's the euro cup and that  there's  always another cup so they could sell  you more more stickers anyway so he says  typically the soccer sticker hype comes  around with every world cup and women  usually accept it because you can't  escape it every year uh but because of  the adults the stickers are too  expensive for kids to collect now so the  children have been priced out of the  market because there's so many  middle-aged men who want to buy up and  collect the stickers so i know you say  you say that women accept it  i don't know if women do accept this  okay i don't think women accept any of  this stuff i don't think women accept  their husbands  collecting video games or collecting uh  figurines or uh  uh  arcade machines i don't think they do i  don't think women really accept their  husbands  um  buying and modifying old cars and all  this crap i don't think i don't think  women that do accept men watching sports  all the time and things i think the vast  majority of women judge their husbands  and boyfriends with their arms folded  you know i think that a lot of women  look down their nose with contempt at  their husbands and boyfriends and this  may justify a lot of different behavior  on the  the wife's side right it can lead to  different kinds of revenge within a  relationship  okay so where was i before i digress  [Laughter]  talking about nostalgia and the the  various frankly dangerous and harmful  ways in which people try to recapture  their youth and then i started talking  about the sexual aspect of this in which  people are you know so middle-aged  people or old and elderly people are  pursuing the company of and pursuing  sexual relationships with younger people  not because they want to settle down and  have kids with them or frankly you we  can talk about that probably not because  they want to uh really have a  relationship with them like okay like  put it this way a lot of 50 year old men  are not really interested in hearing an  18 year old's perspective on politics  like men who are pursuing dramatically  younger women they're probably not  interested apart from the question of  having kids together they're probably  not really interested in an intellectual  relationship or you know hearing that  woman's perspective on the world so and  so forth and again all this is true of  gay couples also there are 50 year old  gay men who are having sex with 18 year  old gay men it's kind of a big deal it's  certainly age gap relationships within  uh gay men it's a big deal now it was a  big deal in ancient athens too this is a  controversy that isn't isn't about to go  away  um but you know there's probably no  openness there  intellectually politically ethically to  seeing the world from that perspective  or hearing that person's perspective uh  on the world and what i'm suggesting is  that actually  this has something in common with the  same yearning that's present in  trying to buy old video games again  trying to reconnect with uh one's youth  in that sense that part of what people  yearn for especially people trapped in  repetitive jobs people who've made  terrible compromises  partly just for economic reasons in  their life people who have in this sense  settle down and become conformists is  that they want to get back in touch with  the creativity and non-conformism of  their youth the malleable person who was  full of possibility and potential they  used to be as a child as a teenager or  or what have you and that one way to  reach out and touch this  is to buy yourself a new famicom buy  itself a video game console yes this  this brings back it evokes um  that flexibility and spontaneity and  sense of potential and sense that i can  be anyone i could do anything i can  become a fireman i can become a soldier  i could do something else in my life i  can be a better person i can still learn  i can still change  but yeah i do think there are also older  people who seek out sexually the company  of younger people because they want to  evoke those same feelings and stuff that  they want to  have that sense of potential again that  sense of optimism again um that sense  that they personally can change they can  they can learn and they've lost that in  their lives so i'm saying there's  something kind of dark and tragic  there  um  so you know  i am as always saying sex is not just  sex  i'm also saying that nostalgia is not  just nostalgia  um  the title of this video  is that nostalgia  is an attempt  to  vindicate  the stupidity  of your childhood  with the stupidity  of adulthood  and i think maybe that's the necessary  next step  in the analysis i've already presented  if you're unhappy with the compromises  you've made if you're unhappy with the  life of conformism the repetition and  someone that you've bought into as an  adult probably the most comforting  thought you can think  probably the most comforting belief you  can convince yourself of  is that if you could do it all over  again you would make the same choices  today  you see you would vindicate the  stupidity of your youth with the  stupidity of your adulthood so you know  even with something as simple as video  games and again we can talk about  sexuality we can talk about formal  education career choices and these kinds  of things too  but even with something as simple as  video games it's one thing for me to  look back on hours spent playing video  games and think what a terrible waste  what a loss for my productivity for my  imagination for the person i could be or  or become and to just mourn that as you  know very simply i made the wrong choice  and i may also regret that i had no  better alternative or something it might  not be as simple as saying you know i  made the wrong wrong choice i should  have made a different choice it may also  be regretting that my parents didn't  provide me with a better choice or  whatever you know this was this was the  best i could do given my ignorance to my  situation at the time and so on uh but  you know it's one thing to just look  back at that without right regret  and it's quite another thing to look  back as i think the majority of people  do  and say no that was the greatest  happiness their youth if they could do  it all over again they'd make the same  choice if they could go back in time  knowing all the things they know now  they would still  uh get a d minus  in  english lit because they stayed up all  night playing that video game let's say  civilization you remember the  civilization games there's a game that  keeps you up all night you know i would  still fail that test i would still  neglect my education in some cases also  it's the friends you didn't have it's  the activities you didn't do you know  that you you really didn't make any  friends because you just stayed at home  and played video games that you would  still make those same choices again  um again this is a kind of nostalgia in  the sense i'm talking about it in this  way that looking back in your youth that  you made you made the right choices  um that again from the perspective  of your  adult stupidity  from what you know now in terms of your  current level of ignorance or awareness  that going back to the ignorance of your  youth that you you decide you  rationalize you insist now that you  would or should make the same choices  again now  this can be extended to human sexuality  and other things and it starts to get  really scary does anyone here regret the  person they lost their virginity with  you may regret sleeping with the person  you lost your virginity with  because they were older than you like  you may have been someone who had in  your 20s lost your virginity with  someone in their 50s you might have been  in one of those situations had a youtube  video about that not too long ago  actually anyway that that kind of uh  scenario  uh  you could be someone who lost your  virginity with someone the same age as  yourself you were 16 and they were 16  what have you but you nevertheless now  looking back have a lot of regret  um now you can have regret for all kinds  of reasons you can have regret because  you look back and you say this person  was a bad influence on you you have a  register you look back and say this  person was stupid and lazy and wouldn't  your whole life be better if you instead  at that age you'd been in a relationship  with someone who was sober and  hard-working and had some sense of  clarity of purpose and ambition someone  who had a positive impact on you and  maybe your education and your  intellectual development so on and so  forth of course it can also be regret it  because now you know sexually you know  what is your type you know what you're  attracted to and what you're interested  in again remember the opposite sex  remember the same sex and you now look  back and say oh looking back i was  ignorant then i didn't know what i was  doing and you may feel that this person  took advantage of you you may not you  may feel like you were just bumbling  around you were incompetent like you  don't blame the other person you don't  feel that you were seduced you don't  feel you were taken advantage of but you  still have regret all right well many  people not all  many people in the same way that i've  just described looking back  and justifying the stupidity of your  childhood with the stupidity of  adulthood looking back and saying no  you know the happiest i could have  possibly been was owning and playing  these video games and isn't it appealing  to now buy the same video games now as  an adult you can collect the same video  games you can vindicate the stupidity of  your youth  by appreciating these things as an adult  again right that's what's built into  that when you buy and own these things  again as a middle-aged man you are  declaring and you're demonstrating to  yourself that yes there really was  something great about super mario 64  and you are vindicating the fact that  you used to run home after school and  not care about your homework and not  care about eating dinner and not care  about talking to your parents and you  didn't attend your best friend's  birthday party you didn't go to johnny's  birthday party because you just wanted  to stay home and play mario 64. you know  it's one video game or another you go a  lot of you know what i'm talking about  oh yeah that's right there was a  birthday party i didn't go to i didn't  go to my grandfather's funeral because i  just wanted to stay at home and play  that video game a lot of time there was  some game even it was short term it was  just the first few months you won't buy  your 64 or something for a lot of people  like shift from one addiction to another  you had some intense period where you  didn't care about your friends you  didn't know what your family you  literally didn't care about the food you  ate you just wanted to sit the carpet  and play this video game well you know  what a lot of people sexual infatuation  is even more powerful than that it's  even more overwhelming  and indeed when you look back now you  might realize you were sexually  infatuated with someone who knowing  yourself as you do now having the self  knowledge you know they're not even  attractive to you you know when the sex  was terrible the sex was lousy and then  again you get into the intellectual  components you get the ethical  components intellectually this  relationship was bad for you morally  this relationship was bad for you right  so isn't there a powerful form of  nostalgia isn't there a powerful form of  self-justification isn't there a kind of  vindication  of the stupidity of your youth  by proving to yourself that this is  still what you appreciate this is still  what you want this is still what makes  you happy now as a better informed adult  this is the tragic loop i see a huge  percentage of people trapped in i'm  going to  answer your questions again if you guys  want to make a question or comment or  reply that should apply to now is a good  time if you want to hit the thumbs up  button that was a good time we've had  over 40 people in here but none of you  want to hit the thumbs up button  only 16 thumbs up if you do thumbs up  it'll help people find the video later i  can help people find it and join the  conversation right now you know in terms  of how how uh  youtube works  um  you know  doubt  and intelligence  are two different things  however  don't produces  intelligence  right  living with doubt  self-doubt  but you know doubting what your teachers  told you doubting what your parents told  you doting political authorities in your  own society  doubt  and investigation is what makes you wise  is what makes it was over time it  produces  intelligence most people who are  intelligence are doubting  personalities you know most people who  are highly intelligent people who are  brilliant or what have you and it's a  great mistake to think that confidence  produces intelligence or that  self-confidence and intelligence are the  same thing on a particular topic i may  seem very self-confident you've talked  to me about buddhism i'm very  self-confident talking about first  nations politics or something i seem  very stupid it's because i already did  the work  talk to me about  sexuality and  prostitution in thailand something i've  researched and published papers on and  stuff by the way it's not not my own  interest i've never slept with a  prostitute  but you know like okay this is something  i know about because i've done the  research and it's very easy to think oh  confidence is what's associated with  intelligence or self-confidence is what  produces  and i'm saying to you no it's really  letting yourself doubt letting yourself  doubt what you think you know  letting yourself doubt the wisdom of the  decisions you already have  made  and i understand how hard it is for  people to live with that kind of regret  when doubt leads to regret knowing what  i know now i shouldn't have been playing  that video game at all or i shouldn't  have fallen in love with that person or  i shouldn't have had these kind of  sexual lives  of the people who could be productive  intellectuals in our study of the people  who could be intellectual dissidents of  the people who could be or who actually  are  writers  artists musicians journalists  i think a huge percentage of them live  their lives in terms of this nostalgic  loop of self-justification  self-indication and yes the nostalgia  may be as simple as buying  uh video game console  okay  for a lot of guys  it's going to a bar  and smoking cigarettes and drinking beer  and flirting with younger women even if  they never get laid once it's going to a  music venue and smoking cigarettes and  drinking beer and behaving again as if  they were a high school student the way  they used to go to a live music venue  and hang around when they were that age  there is a an element of nostalgia here  even if you know they're not going back  to listen to the same band like it's not  that they're going back to see the  backstreet boys again it's not some  specific band they listen to as a  teenager right that they're playing the  same role they're acting out the same  script they're insisting when they were  a teenager this is what made them happy  this is what still makes them happy now  when you were a teenager playing this  video game made you happy and you try to  vindicate it you try to appreciate it  now from an adult perspective which is  probably impossible from an adult  perspective mario 64 is the stupidest  [ __ ] thing you can do with your time  any of these video games are right and  from an adult perspective hanging around  at a bar  hanging around in a live music or a life  concert video it's the stupidest thing  you can do the job going to coachella  going to a live music festival and look  as i remember  when you're really a teenager right  going to an event of that kind  is accompanied by  fear  by  danger i was a i was a big dude already  i you know i was i was large compared to  other teenagers just hide and wait you  know i'm not a skinny tall guy i'm not i  wasn't like one of those tall guys who's  spindly or looks weak i was just  generally uh tall and not not uh weak  looking you know what i mean so for me  the danger was less than it was for  people  i could talk about the weapons i carried  in those days too  i went prepared i really was i was  prepared to defend myself going to those  things  uh  but yeah  oh i mean i was gonna say nobody ever  [ __ ] with me or nobody ever stepped to  me  i guess i mean i the only i can remember  a situation where someone tried to start  a fight with a friend of mine  at a at an event like at a social music  event like this and then i stood up  you know and said look if you're kicking  his ass you're kicking my ass i can't  remember one person  stepping to me directly but i was  prepared anyway i was just going to say  you know this we're talking about being  like 15 16 here guys like  i was you know i was young and ignorant  and stupid right well you say  uh for a lot of people maybe maybe for  you you're a teenager maybe it's not  going to a bar or nightclub or live  music video maybe it's going to a strip  club right okay my point is like let's  say let's say you were a stereotypical  presbyterian presbyterian-american  you're an american given a christian  upbringing the first time you go to a  strip club there's all this fear there's  fear of sin there's fear of divine  punishment divine retribution there's  fear of what your grandmother would  think of you what if someone finds out  there's also like direct fear of  violence fear of drugs fear of crime  like this fear of this being a kind of  den of sin den of iniquity you're going  to into a strip club right you know my  point is whether it's going to a punk  rock show a rap show oh god  really sorry  what is more menacing going to a live  rap music event or going to a strip club  you know sorry it can be really awful  going to live rap events it's horrible  nobody dances right nobody nobody enjoys  themselves you go to [ __ ] rapping and  all the dudes are trying to act tough  they're trying to act like they're about  to have a phys  if everyone acts like you're not  enjoying yourself listening to the rap  music this is a typical look i'm  obviously in my day maybe today  everyone's smiling and bouncing up and  down in a rap club i don't know but let  me tell you back in my day everyone was  trying to have their hat as low as  possible on their head and you know  grimace and and frown for the whole time  you're at this rap everyone act like  you're on the edge of having a fistfight  it was just ridiculous anyway my point  is yeah when you did that as a teenager  it was interesting because it was  terrifying you were weak and ignorant  and stupid right and i  mentioned this example before but i can  remember the first time  i played the bonus level on sonic the  hedgehog 2. it has the simulated  three-dimensional effect sonic the  hedgehog 2 for sega genesis i was  already old enough that i realized this  is like the last time i'm gonna feel  this way and it was we're just for a few  minutes you're just enraptured by what  you see on the screen it's just  overwhelming to you it's just so  unexpected and mind-boggling to see  these blinking lights on the screen it's  a totally child-like element and i was  aware i was playing sonic 2. we could  figure out how old that was  probably 1990 1991 sonic 2 or something  like that maybe 1990. but anyway  sorry sonic 1 is 89 so sonic 2 is i  think 1990. i think that was what it was  google it tell me that i'm wrong  but you know i remember you know feeling  overwhelmed by that but being old enough  and cynical enough to realize like this  isn't going to go on in my life this is  a childlike reaction to a spectacle  they're just seeing something on screen  and feeling so overwhelmed by it i can't  ever have that again already when i was  13 years old or 14 years old you  couldn't have that anymore you're not  stupid enough right well guess what the  things that made it compelling and  terrifying and sexy to go to a live  music event when you were a teenager  you know look let's be real  not my experience but the things that  made it terrifying and exciting to cheat  on your boyfriend  that made it terrifying and exciting or  to cheat on your girlfriend cheat on  your husband or wife when you were young  and stupid and ignorant that's also not  going to be exciting or addressed  anymore you're too smart for that you've  got you can't do it anymore you can't be  overwhelmed that way and i just say  sorry it's actually a good it's a good  comparison i hadn't thought this before  but if i think about that feeling  the first time i saw the bonus level on  sonic the hedgehog 2. just wow i just  can't believe what i'm looking at here  again it's  blinking lights  it's it's a visual illusion really it's  like looking at a puzzle but it's moving  and it's glowing in front of you you  know it's all it's all it is okay you  know what if i think back long enough  and i guess i can remember  meeting a beautiful woman and having  that same just like wow  you know like wow this chick is so  gorgeous but i mean  i was never stupid enough to really  objectify them i'd always because i  remember being an early teenager this  way i come around i'm thinking of a  particular uh i mean she was saying  jabba she was 18 and i was 18 or  whatever you know uh you meet an  amazingly gorgeous woman  but right away as soon as you start  talking to them because i did i talked  to the i didn't i didn't just look at  them from afar or something like you  realize the sorrow  and agony and ambition  and uncertainty that they live with like  you realize the tragedy and the struggle  that is their life  and like the question isn't is this  person good looking or like do i want to  look at them is this like a poster or a  painting yeah like a painting you just  look at a beautiful painting right it's  like  this is this person's sorrow this is  their struggle do i want to be a part of  it like that's how i feel when i'm  talking to beautiful women and  99.9 percent of the time the answer is  is no i remember just remember one  particular girl i talked to this this  wasn't one of my girlfriends one of the  girls i slept but this isn't someone  even kissed but remember i met her she  was just unbelievably beautiful  and it was just surprising to me at that  time see i was more naive than i was now  that she was really attracted to me i  just wasn't expecting it you know you're  a kid you don't understand how these  things work like you don't realize how  attractive someone else is has nothing  to do with how attractive they find you  an ugly person can be attracted to you  or beautiful like it's just there's no  cause of it you know you were a kid and  you still think there are like levels to  this game or something like oh you think  someone that beautiful would never be  attracted to me so this this girl and  again this is not one of my  ex-girlfriends isn't someone i ever  kissed or did you said this one  conversation and she was absolutely  gorgeous and i started talking to her  and you know my style was i would just  talk to a woman the same way i talked to  a man i just just talked to her like a  like a friend i wasn't trying to seduce  her or something and you know  her family were new immigrants to canada  her parents didn't really speak english  you know like right away you start here  with me she's she's beautiful this is  her life story this is what she's  worried about  um i think she'd already finished high  school it's like i was still in high  school you know uh  you know what job she's gonna go into  and what she's you know obviously  toronto rent was very high now it's  impossibly high so at that time when we  were finishing high school people were  worried about renting their first  apartment today that's just impossible  in toronto i don't think anyone even i  don't think anyone rents an apartment  the day they finish high school in  toronto anymore i think that's something  in the past you know  unless you're unless you're very wealthy  you know but you know like  by the way i'm not blaming her or  something this is this is natural this  is real life you talk to someone who's  just finished high school this is their  worry this is their sorrow this is the  raggedy and i said but like this is a  whole human being and you're meeting  them at one  moment in their life like i'm not  stupid enough to sexually objectify  someone or be fascinated by them the way  as i say as children were certainly  fascinated by by video games and  certainly also by the way as as a child  as a teenager you can be fascinated by a  poster  of a beautiful woman or beautiful man  you can be fascinated by watching a tv  show with a beautiful woman of a movie  when then it's much easier to dehumanize  them right an idol on the stage right  that's not someone who has to have this  kind of complexity in the sense of their  struggle and  are you getting involved with their  sorrow and their suffering and what have  you in life you know so  yeah  um  in trying to vindicate  the stupidity of your own youth right  you are in a sense making yourself more  stupid right now you're making yourself  more stupid in trying to  appreciate and enjoy childish things in  a childish way  and in trying to  appreciate and enjoy teenage things in a  teenage way or you know if we even go a  little bit later 21 year old things in a  in a 21 year old way instead of pardon  me  instead of letting yourself go through  that doubt  doubt and self-doubt examination  and really admit to yourself if i knew  then what i know now i wouldn't have  made any of the same choices and  you know the things that you thought  were  pleasant and enjoyable admitting to  yourself that they're not pleasant or  enjoyable at all you know that admitting  to yourself that you were wrong about  fundamentally what is good in life what  is good about relationships with the  opposite sex being frankly an easy  example um but you know  there is no way as a child or a teenager  i could have known how to educate myself  and how to compensate for  what was bad and evil and wrong in my  own school education so i haven't  mentioned this to melissa before  i had quite a nasty correspondence with  someone on instagram i forget it was  yesterday the day before yesterday i  haven't been getting a lot of sleep  lately maybe the day before yesterday  so someone on instagram and this person  isn't a friend of mine but you know i'm  connected to people who are not really  friends of mine  someone on instagram posted a a public  statement about how important it is that  we as white people i'm being included as  white here for the purposes of this  conversation whether or not i count as a  white person as another investigation  that we as white people take the time  to read about first nations history  american indian history  yeah  so whatever mohawk cree ojibwe inuits  this is what you're this is what we're  talking about right  now  i had absolutely no bad intentions  but i took a screenshot of this  statement  and  wrote in saying hey look you know like i  appreciate you have these good  intentions and just said you know i  studied this stuff myself  and i recommended some of the books we  have on the shelf right now i said look  if you're going to follow through with  it if you're going to do this reading  you know  actually one of the things i said well i  think it's really important that you  don't read books that are too boring or  too depressing about this because you'll  you'll get discouraged like you know if  you read books some of these books  they're really boring some of them are  really depressing and the actual  statement it suggested  uh reading a certain government report  on uh basically human rights and history  of our indigenous people which i know  it's very boring and very dishonest it's  bad it's bad factory it's also you know  it'll be it'll be boring as well as  misinforming you you know  um so that was all i was running in to  say and you can imagine you know all  people are on the internet people make  this kind of statement they have  absolutely no intention of reading even  a single book they just want to be  applauded by other people on instagram  or other people on facebook  oh yeah good for you like good sentiment  or whatever so actually this person sent  me a bunch of nasty messages back and i  uh i i did actually reply i took the  time said look i want one of the things  i said is look this right back to my  phrasing before  you know i said look i was born and  raised in canada  my girlfriend  was born and raised in detroit so if you  don't know that's almost canada that's  right in the border between  uh canada united states i said look i  think  all of us  every single one of us  if you have a heart and a brain  you are [ __ ] up  by the history of slavery by the history  of genocide and by a dim awareness  that whatever you were taught about this  in high school  was a lie  like you know and a lot of them maybe  kind of namby pamby well intentionalized  like depending what generation you are  where you grew up what school you went  to the lies they may not be hideous  obvious lies like you know holocaust  denial and this kind of thing right they  may be kind of convenient comfortable  reassuring lies you know they may be  optimistic  multicultural um anti-racist lies but  like you have grown up  with an awareness of your own ignorance  with an awareness of this enormous  shadow cast over your life and then  there's this question of what do we do  right now so i was saying this complete  stranger on instagram look the reason  i'm writing you is look i like i know i  messed up with this i know my girlfriend  is messed up with this i think most of  us are i would i saw you make this  statement we should all be better read  and less we should all take the time to  get well informal history i would say oh  great you know if you want to do that  that's something i did with several  years of my life i put years of my life  into getting better informed about that  obviously there's more i could learn i'm  not the world's greatest expert but  compared to most other white people  compared to 98.5 percent white people  let's be honest compared to 99.9 percent  white people i'm a lot better informed  on this this the history the politics of  the languages you know all this all this  other stuff so if you want to do that  great here are some here are some books  um okay  isn't it so much easier  to reassure yourself that you made the  right choice that you did the best you  could  you know  isn't it hard to live with that doubt  whether or not you're going to do  something about it right whether or not  you're going to act on it positively  right isn't it you know isn't it hard to  live with that gnawing doubt one there's  something here i'm ignorant of right two  i know i was lied to  and like how i cope with that because we  all had to write essays about it i know  people went to summer camp about this  stuff like they went to like genocide  summer camp in effect you know i mean  you went to museums you went on a maybe  did you ever do this melissa were they  take you on a tour of an historic fort  like a place where the battles were  fought between white people and indians  white people want indians  well there's white people  but there's a lot of that you know the  same way so in america it's it's even  more common to go to a civil war  recreation of a fight yeah or something  like this but you know an actual  uh anyway just one of the look a  battlefield say or uh you know  where there used to be a fortification  and those the genocidal battles or  thought where that history was decided  you know like  it's really hard to live with the  awareness i could have gone to the  library i could have done my own reading  i could have challenged the teacher i  could have challenged the textbook the  text was written  and i didn't  i played sonic the hedgehog i played  mario 64.  and to some extent i bought into the lie  and i participated and to some extent i  still am like i'm still caught up in it  and i still don't know what to do in  dealing with that that history of of  genocide so i'm just i'm just laying out  here the alternative to nostalgia is to  live with this terrible self-doubt this  doubt directed towards the authority  figures in your life your parents your  teachers your priests your rabbis your  university professors your textbooks the  authors of the textbook this terrible  doubt and then to actually go out and  challenge that and challenge your own  ignorance and to live with with real  depth of regret in terms of the choices  you made as a child as a teenager maybe  even also in in university you want you  want to come up here yeah yeah i could  yeah  yeah i could definitely respond to some  of the topics that you've discussed so  far i'm not sure how long you've been  recording now one hour  yeah so something that i was thinking of  in response to living with self-doubt so  thumbs up for melissa coming on camera  by the way  yeah thanks  so  early on in this discussion i'm pretty  sure it's this discussion  we've been talking beforehand this  morning so some things i'm not sure  that we discussed in person or discussed  in your video yes  so  you were talking about living with  instability in your life whereas  you know contrasting this with  what a lot of people's experiences in  america where they live wake up and go  to the same job every day right and then  in a sense they have a rebellious  attitude towards this they want to repel  they want to right break out of what  they feel is which and they may rebel by  doing something as unimaginative as  cheating on their wife and they may  rebel by buying classic video games so  just to be clear they may rebel by  joining a communist revolutionary group  or becoming an anarchist but that's a  pretty small pretty small percentage of  people go and they may rebel by hanging  out at bars and listening to punk rock  music so yes we're just saying we're  using rebellion in this broadest sense  rebelling against the monotheists going  in yes so i was reminded of a  conversation that i had with my father a  few years ago now where i was discussing  basically the questioning that i had  about my career at the time and  what i was going to do in the future  where we would live you know  basically in the whole five years that  we've been together  we've gone through a series of  uh  hopes and dreams that have fallen apart  and you know plans for moving somewhere  that have fallen apart or you know that  we've not necessarily fallen apart but  we've picked them apart you know we've  we've really gone through  all of the worrying beforehand that's  something that you've always said you  know like think about all the worst case  scenarios beforehand uh before you make  a decision before you decide on  something and even still you know you  might encounter things that you didn't  expect  of course um  and his response was like you know  if you are so  worrying and doubting all the time  how are you ever going to make progress  and he said that i'm frozen that i can't  make a decision because  no it's exactly through worrying and  donating but i'm going to make progress  that's the road to progress  you know put things into action um and  see how see how things happen so yeah  because you know it's one of the few  conversations i've i've had that where  somebody's actually right you know  questioning me and  putting me on game that way with this  kind of attitude that i've picked up  where you know  there's there's the first stage where uh  you know when you're first learning to  be more doubting of what you've done in  the past and reflecting on it and  actually being honest with yourself like  oh i do regret this or i do regret that  i wish i wouldn't have done this or  wouldn't have done that you know i was i  was remembering the things that you said  about going to shows as a teenager you  know just right the fear and definitely  i remember that going to a few  shows in my teenage years where you know  you're living with in this this yeah  gripped by the fear of uh being and for  one of my experiences was a metal show  yeah you know um it's just i i had one  female friend i remember she told me  about being groped at shows too you know  she's saying men grabbing her bomb and  stuff yeah well this this is like just  seeing people actually like hitting each  other seeing the  crowd  having like injuries and bleeding on  their face and stuff yep right you know  like that and thinking that's cool yeah  no i i was just cool man wow  but there were people who were there not  not despite the danger but because of it  because they wanna they wanna be the guy  who has blood coming from his face after  about yeah that's right yeah just the  screaming to the kind of like yes  yes  uh animalistics  noises going on yeah um you know just  thinking i wouldn't want to do that at  all and i can't imagine being 29 years  old and wanting to relive that and go  through that again and at a certain  point this is not interesting anymore  that's exactly when people do it too i  think women at 29 are going to coachella  more like it's like oh i'm going to turn  30. like how many 29 women 29 year old  women are going to music festivals and  doing these like they're doubling down  while they're still in their 20s to try  to do as much teenage crap as possible  yeah i just said and i think there are  29 women who are trying to sleep around  with as many men as possible  i think some of those women have gotten  in touch with me you know who you  i for sure i for sure think i think  there are women who are 29 and they're  trying to sleep with as many handsome  youtubers as possible or something but  and they imagine they're going to settle  down and get married and have a kid you  know  soon soon thereafter or something yeah  like wow but no there's a lot i think  just say 29 especially for women but  ferment for men too i think maybe  there's even more of this this kind of  toxic nostalgia shall we say yeah  yeah anyway yeah i've been reflecting on  it a bit more recently too and and when  i was listening to you just  how this has been  maybe some of the  unknown the fear of the unknown or um  just the  haven't haven't having gone through  like  the emotional  uh intelligence  progress that i have like just becoming  a i don't know  able to cope with life you know these  these kind of things that are necessary  as you mature as you get older um just  just being able to handle yourself and  being able to handle what life throws at  you um  yeah at a certain point like i've become  really  i don't know if cynical is too has too  many negative connotations but yes i i  know what you're saying where i couldn't  possibly enjoy going to a metal show and  i couldn't find it interesting because  uh you know i've reached the point where  that's not interesting to me and i'm  reminded of this um video that i saw  recently  from a youtuber who was talking about  her experience of  now that she's had a baby she's really  excited to go to places that beforehand  before they had a baby she had just lost  interest she's like i don't really want  to go to uh this uh yeah this event  because  it's it's all like  i've done it before you know like she  lived her 20s that's she did a lot of  drinking she did a lot of she went to a  lot of just shows and uh events and you  know she lived a pretty pretty wild  lifestyle and uh perhaps dissolute is a  better one  yes  yeah absolutely but now that she's uh at  a baby she's thinking oh you know i  can't wait to go to this just uh  the green greenhouse or something that's  in her in her town right you know like  where you can show you show the it's  just more exciting now that you have a  child to show the world and you know  this is what is making it interesting  rather than anything that's  intellectually you know interesting to  her it's it's really the experience of  introducing this to another human being  yeah that that's making the experience  enjoyable um  [Music]  yeah just just yeah reflecting on on  that too like um  i think some people just want to feel  something again they want to feel that  uncertainty that fear and and put  themselves back in the mindset of  before they became cynical before  they've  been through heartbreak been through you  know  devastation in their lives and come back  through it  yeah well  right and and so let me ask this  um  you guys don't know this about me this  isn't anything particularly profound but  you know very often when i'm watching  the news with melissa there's some  humanitarian disaster in the world it  could be war it could be an earthquake  it could be whatever and you know i  start saying to her like oh we should go  like we should think about going and  living there for a number of years  and  you know sometimes it's just an  opportunity for melissa and i to kind of  learn more about the place  i mean recently what we we watched a  documentary with the history of um  uh sorry the the 51st state in america  what's it called it's um  are we talking about hawaii no no no  that's the 50th day oh puerto rico  puerto rico yeah yeah puerto rico which  has this uh that i call it favorite city  because it's it's unofficially it's not  quite but you know there was a news item  of puerto rico but we we talked about  like oh you know we could move to puerto  rico and you know and we talked about  the history and politics and we watched  a youtube video about it we read some  stuff just out of a wikipedia article in  that case but you know uh sometimes also  melissa is actually quite worried i  remember what i started reading and  telling you about the history of nepal  i was saying look we could we could live  in nepal we could go live there for 10  years something permanently yeah you're  like [ __ ] you're actually going to do it  aren't you because she knows you know  i'm capable of the same way i moved to  cambodia at one point in my life i  actually can up stakes and go start new  life in nepal or start new life and i  mean puerto rico is easier than nepal  and starts you know start studying the  language and the politics and it can be  rewarding for me you know so my point is  not to be a tourist my point is to  actually be involved in the politics and  the history as unfolds you know  to really be intellectually engaged  ethically committed you know trying to  make the world a better place really  living living a meaningful life in these  places i'm not i'm not talking about  tourism i'm not even talking about  visiting i'm not you know and obviously  the fact that they're disasters means  there's a potential to humanitarian work  of some kind to make some kind of  altruistic uh difference that way you  know  i just say when you're talking about  things being  exciting terrifying challenging for you  once you're an adult once you're  minimized right that would be the kind  of challenge oh absolutely yeah no but  but my point is nobody does that in our  culture incredibly few people even  even think in those terms like that's  the point is it's it's middle-aged men  want to cheat on their wives or want to  hang around in a bar or want to go to a  nightclub you have the quote unquote  excitement of their youth again and  indeed as i've already explained i see  the same impulse they want to buy a  video game system or these these other  things and probably this extends to some  extent to buying a sports car or  something too might might not be a  perfect example um why it is you know  middle-aged men want to buy a sportswear  to have quote-unquote excitement  what is exciting about a sports car but  like what would really be exciting in  this way what would really create that  sense of doubt and fear  would be to move to africa  you know and to really do it all the way  to really learn their language and learn  their politics and take their history  and their politics and make it your  history and your politics like not  not to just remain an expat with a  shallow level of engagement but to  really commit to um and really you sorry  let's just say it's uganda i'm just  picking up an example we could pick any  country in africa but we can't say a  whole continent you know but where you  you pick a particular town in uganda and  you really care about the future of that  of that town you care about the future  of that country you care about the  future that that talent so on and so  forth and you and you commit to it  um  you know and again obviously it doesn't  have to be africa um it could be  cambodia we could use any any number of  examples here you know i just point out  those kinds of things things that are  really challenging in a really  meaningful way things that challenge  your sense of who you are and force you  to change and adapt that's you know  that's a totally different story but  that  what percentage of people  even think that through  you know yeah sorry  yeah we'll just say i mean just going  back to that idea about stability and  instability yeah i think yes although  there is an element where people want to  rebel against the stability the  conformity uh you know this this man was  talking about they want to rebel  but not too much yeah right they don't  want to go all the way with it uh  that is a bit sad to me to reflect on  because um right from my position right  now i i do  i am more of that same camp where i'm  thinking okay you know  this is an opportunity for me to go  somewhere and do something and  but you could make a difference even you  considering joining the army was like  that yes you know but like that's really  a change that's really gonna happen it's  not it's not a vacation you know this is  a life-altering change and you've got to  worry about it and think it through yes  right but i mean that and but i can  imagine someone also joining the army  for kind of rebellious reasons like that  oh i want to change my life you know  sign up for them well you're still the  same [ __ ] now you got a uniform  yes you're still the same person you  bring all your problems with you but i  would say too and you know i've known  about this kind of situation but it's  also in a lot of literature and what  have you but the man who cheats on his  wife with a younger woman because he  wants to rebel against the status quo  just a little bit  but then it ends up ruining his marriage  causing a divorce and let's say the  younger woman gets pregnant and now he's  got to get married to her and raise that  kid well all he wanted was to  supplement the life he already had like  he only wanted a distraction or a  dalliance right he wanted to keep the  same wife and kids he already had and he  wanted to have this as a minor  form of entertainment on the side or  something or as indeed nostalgia in the  sense we're talking about this video if  you just joined us i explained what i  mean about nostalgia in this context  when i have this nest out to relive his  youth by cheating on his wife with a  younger woman he didn't really want to  rebel all the way he didn't want to  actually divorce his wife change his  whole life start again with it with a  new wife or girlfriend but that's what  it led to yeah because you don't want it  to actually be in that position where  you are remaking yourself you are  starting from scratch again right which  you're remembering as this wonderful  optimistic time period where you had so  much  so many different opportunities so many  different ways that you could go so many  different paths you could walk down but  when you actually are forced with that  reality of of starting from scratch  right you know for this man yeah  but you know incredibly few people let's  say you have a repetitive job that's  well paying enough let's say you're a  bank teller i've only ever known one  person who was a bank teller i didn't  know where that well  we had a couple conversations you know a  job we were paid well but it's exactly  the same thing every day right you know  you you still could do anything with  your life if you have the stability and  income of being a bank teller you could  be studying to become a medical doctor  you could become a surgeon you could be  studying and preparing anything is  possible like really if you are a  middle-aged bank teller you have more  options and more opportunities than you  had as a teenager in high school yeah  any job you want to be an architect well  being a bank teller first is a great  basis to burden you want to be a  stand-up comedian you want to be a  musician you want to be a youtuber well  you've got this steady boring job as a  bank teller it's the same everyday you  could be doing that right but most of  these people they only want to rebel a  little bit so they're a bank teller and  they may really feel consumed by that  they feel consumed partly with the  awareness that they could have been an  architect or they could have been a  comedian that could have been a musician  or something there's something they  wanted to do where they could have been  a police officer right like it could be  something as simple as that but they  don't they don't actually want to quit  their job and do it they don't want to  take the risk so what are they going to  do they're going to cheat on their  husband or they're going to cheat on  their wife they're going to go sleep  with a 18 year old or 22 year old  they're going to go have an affair  they're going to do something that's  rebellious but it's only a little bit  rebellious and there's this nostalgic  reliving of that feeling of potential of  youth that you could be someone else you  could learn you become something else  right but they don't actually they don't  actually want to rebel but look i just  want to poke this in it may seem  different but tragically it's it's  related to the same  drugs  drugs can be like that for so many  people the pattern i described of the  man who only wants to rebel against his  wife and his the and the monotony of his  job a little bit by cheating a little  bit well guess what now you're cheating  all the way guess what it went further  than you thought it would the  consequences were not what you expect  them to be  you know there are middle-aged people  who start using cocaine and they think  it's only going to be something they do  once or twice a month they think it's  only going to be you know and for them  it may be we're living there getting  back to their teenage years or what they  did in university they're going to go to  a certain kind of music event and do  cocaine or again it could be we could  put in any drug here but you know  they're going to go and just use this  drug a little bit and have this little  bit of rebellion and this little bit of  nostalgia and this little bit of  dissimulated youthfulness in their life  right a second childhood a renewed  second set of teenage years oh well  guess what you thought you were only  going to rebel a little bit and now  you're rebelling all the way now you've  lost your job now your wife has left you  like you know because you're using  cocaine or whatever it is now you're  hanging out with pimps and prostitutes  and drug dealers now everything has  changed in both qualitative and  quantitative ways that you didn't you  didn't yeah and ultimately you have to  question like  have they not gone through the process  of just thinking am i too old for this  you know  at what point you know when i think  about that  in relation to cheating on wives and  husbands you know at a certain point i  just are you ever too old to really feel  that infatuation when you talk you know  you said  you can think back to when you were  young  right you know you saw a beautiful woman  you just it's overwhelming wow very  beautiful person yeah um but then you  know even at that stage when you talk to  them you know you start to realize who  they are with all their sorrows with all  the struggles that they've been through  and  do i want that in my life do i do i want  to take on their sorrows their struggles  yeah um at a certain point  and that is what you have to realize  without  any uh relationship with with a romantic  partner that that's what you're that's  the responsibility that you're taking on  and  i i just i appreciate  and  live with this same kind of doubt about  this aspect of it that yeah and if  you're if you're sober and honest that  doubt will be productive it'll lead to  you living a different life and a better  life i mean if you're not sober and  you're not honest with yourself you're  not honest with us it won't you can live  a lie or whatever you know so i want to  respond to some of the the uh questions  the audience okay you know what i say  yeah i think you can stay okay so you  know um when i say stay it's as opposed  to sitting in a different chair by the  way guys so i just want to say so here's  a guy iowa shout out to iowa says quote  cocaine and mister says you better be a  higher higher earner so iowa i don't  know how old you are i'm not saying this  insult but like you could be 18 you  could be 68 you know you just you just  don't know but you don't know poor  people do all this stuff too  like  you may think like maybe your experience  life or maybe you're young and you're  inexperienced  bro  rice farmers in cambodia do  all this [ __ ] like seriously cattle  herders in africa people in third world  countries in third world conditions  urban poor people in the ghetto  everything we've discussed here bro  poor people do it too rich people are  more often discussed in the newspapers  rich people are more often depicted in  movies doing this just for no reason  like hollywood movies are  they tend to focus on people with with  lavish lifestyles rather than people  but no every single thing we've talked  about in this video including cocaine  and cheating on your wife bro you know  poor people do it too and i would just  say likewise there's a kind of  distorting  myopia brought into this by  the hollywood and and even by youtube  like by now decentralized social media  you know if you think it's only  beautiful people who do this  ugly people do it too fat people do it  too like it's it's not the case like if  you're a woman and you marry a fat guy  because you think he's not going to  cheat on you  think again like if you marry a fat guy  you think well he's fat but he's  hard-working and honest and sober like  he won't ever become a druid fat people  become drug addicts too and like you  know fat people certainly we're talking  about nostalgia in other ways fat people  start amassing video game collections  and you know all this stuff you know  there is no this does nothing to do with  how attractive you are how wealthy you  are so on and so forth so  i'm just going to respond to you this  might seem like a um  uh this might seem like a shallow  comment but yeah so iowa the same guy  says  that he's watched some of tko sam's  videos and and this guy says iowa says  that he feels that like 50  of the white men living in tokyo or like  this it's just that tico sam is the guy  who's made a video so if you don't know  tico samus don't worry about it it's  just it's just an example  um  so look i do think  nostalgia and the perpetuation of  childishness  has a special significance  in the study of japan you know like even  the university level like formal like  japanology whatever you want to say you  know  japonology as opposed to sinology  however you want to put it you know um  it does  and  the perpetuation of teenage attitudes in  your teenage years  because professional childhood is one  thing perpetual high school  dumb is is another uh it really does so  i'm going to give you a couple of really  quick contrasts  have you ever sat down in a classroom  with a bunch of people white people i'm  sorry it doesn't really matter if you're  to quote michael jackson doesn't matter  if you're black or white but i mean  people who are born and raised in  america or people who are born and  raised in western europe regardless of  the color of their skin but so if you  sat down with americans and europeans  see it now i have to include australians  how am i going to make up this camera  have you sat down in a classroom of  americans and europeans who have devoted  their life to the study of tibet  tibetan as a language dependent politics  and tibetan history they're so different  from the people who study japan  they are  so  different  and you guys know i don't like tibetan  buddhism i do not glorify tibetan  buddhism i do not support tibetan  nationalism i don't you know i'm not  sympathetic to that cause okay no if you  if you think this is too kind of high  and verified an example talking about  people who are like studying in  university one thing it's not anyone can  enroll in those classes like literally  if any any university that has a  department with professors of tibetology  professors teaching tibetan tibetan  anyone can go and enroll so it's not  really illegal anyone who can afford it  can go  um  white people  who choose to become english teachers in  tibet they're very much the same  character but people who just prepare  and they start studying tibetan as a  language and they go to live and work in  tibet as an english secular energy  they are totally different from the  people who choose to go into japanese as  a language and move  totally now this isn't the only contrast  we could offer i could go through a  whole bunch of countries for the world  but i think tibet is a it's an  instructive one right away right and by  the way some of those people who go to  tibet some of them do get married to a  tibetan woman or a tibetan man like i've  met those people too i've known some of  those people uh you know some of them do  like some of them their sex life is is  part of it or whatever um  you know  the relationship of the foreign observer  to japan  it's kind of  uniquely imbued  with this toxic  nostalgia  now why  i'm guys i'm here to be honest with you  i think there are two factors that are  extraordinary  nobody grows up watching  tibetan cartoons  nobody  when i was in the classroom with people  learning japanese and when you're on  youtube looking guys like tko sam you  are very often looking at white people  or black people or hispanic people  western people european and american  people who grew up  watching japanese cartoons playing  japanese video games reading japanese  comic books that doesn't exist with  tibet [ __ ] i'm not saying this to  insult anyone do you know any white  people who grew up reading african comic  books watching african movies african  cartoons playing african video games  i've never met a single white person and  i've met white people who grew up in  africa literally i meant white people  were born and raised in africa  they didn't watch african tv they  watched white people tv whatever i said  you know they watched european and  american tv growing up they grew up in  africa watching the dukes of hazzard  watching california movies made in los  angeles california i mean this this kind  of thing so this is  extraordinary you're like  anywhere else in the world you can  compare it to if you're uh  again nobody grew up watching cambodian  cartoons right i you know at one point  in my life i was studying cambodia's  language i chose both in terms of  humanitarian work and and research right  okay so do you want to say that yeah i  couldn't i'm not going to figure out  i've even had to think about this with  chinese cartoons just right in language  study because i was looking for right  and that may come in the future we're  recording this near 2022. it is possible  in the future people will grow up with  chinese cartoons chinese video games  chinese but but currently it's not  currently there aren't any people my age  who grew up with with chinese culture  that way because of communism and other  factors right not not compared to  japanese yeah no i was watching a video  from a youtuber who lives who  lives in china and she was going to a  coffee shop in beijing  in beijing they have this there's  there's a coffee shop that has a bunch  of uh paraphernalia or uh  toys from the 1950s basically it's  old-school old-school toys and you know  this is interesting to tourists because  they just didn't have any although  many people in america grow up playing  with toys that are made in china uh they  they don't have any uh actual like  they aren't playing with toys that are  played with in china you know like yes  yeah so there's this disconnect between  yes these cultures so yeah right no i'm  sorry so just to flesh that out the  point is you can live in america and own  a barbie doll that says made in china  and so i don't know that's still true  when i was a kid it said it on her foot  so if you turn it upside it said in tiny  letters on barbie's foot made in china  um i don't know if that's still true  today or not you can play with a gi joe  a soldier a toy soldier that's made in  china however it's designed in the  united states of america  it is  uh barbie is culturally american it's  not chinese influence japanese influence  is not like that people are playing with  japanese toys even if the japanese toys  are also made in china they may not be  made in japan  but it is it's a it's a japanese  narrative it's a japanese story and this  is a very powerful thing now a question  i asked just in a written comment on the  internet yesterday is how comfortable  are you with saudi arabia entering that  competition we all seem to have  thoughtlessly just embraced japanese  influence in raising our children our  children are going to grow up with  japanese fables and a lot of deep  japanese cultural influence well guess  what saudi arabia's got money and  influence too they just bought up a  japanese video game company the neo geo  company it's called snk the company but  they're famous video game consoles neo  geo it's now owned by the saudis how  comfortable you with your kids watching  cartoons playing video games reading  comic books that are controlled and by a  saudi corporation or made to reflect  saudi taste and this is i mean this is  part of the reality of multiculturalism  there will be there will start to be  anime made in africa if there isn't  already by the way there will start to  be cultural products competing for the  attention of children made in south  america made in africa made in cambodia  made in saudi arabia  but for people who are alive today in  2022 there is a unique  overweening powerful significance to  japan that is not like anywhere else and  i just mentioned for the sake of  completeness  there were black people in new york city  especially  who grew up with hong kong movies hong  kong action movies in the 1980s 1970s  yeah 1970s and 1980s both um that's true  but at that time hong kong was very  different from china it was very  different politically and culturally and  those action movies they were they were  made with the hope of reaching a western  audience in a certain way that's very  different and you could you could  probably talk about it and that's over  now that culture is now dead but you can  talk about i mean the famous rap group  wu-tang wu-tang clan the reason why it's  called wu-tang clan is the reason why  they use their name and the names of  many of their particular songs yeah they  were influenced by hong kong action  movies right but this is not really  chinese culture at that time you really  have to talk about that as hong kong  culture and it seems like that's over  and done with i think it's fair to say  it's interesting contrast hong kong  had more cultural influence in new york  city  in the 1970s than it has today like  today it's less of today japan today  today there are black kids growing up in  new york who watch dragon ball z and  play the video game and use the  collectible cards like pokemon stuff  like this you know like there's this  huge influence in the childhood of black  people in new york city again white  people and hispanic people also it's  just the examples of black people from  japan but is there that influence  anymore from hong kong no not at all in  my opinion that's not just that's  actually decreased in terms of communist  china the answer is no or not yet you  know communist china doesn't have  anything comparable to pokemon uh in our  lives and i've for a lot of children  i've had a few people admitted to me a  few like i feel embarrassed but  pokemon's a huge part of some people's  some people's lives so this is one  element and now i'm not going to repeat  everything i said in the first hour of  this video  but  this brings with it the potential for  toxic nostalgia to an unbelievable  extent and what i see is people going on  again and again  um  trying to vindicate the stupidity of  their youth with the stupidity of  adulthood but look here's another  difference  and you know some people are  uncomfortable talking about this  you know what the difference is  between japan  and tibet  what percentage  of the mouse clicks on pornhub  are to watch japanese pornography  and what percentage are to watch tibetan  pornography  like  does tibetan pornography even exist does  cambodian pornography even exist and  look in the future it probably will like  i i know like  on the internet everything exists or  something you can find if you search for  it now you can find examples of tibetan  women in pornography i'm not saying  there's zero on the internet but this is  a dominant influence in the lives of  many americans growing up many western  europeans remember  japanese porn both anime porn like  erotic anime erotic manga erotic movies  of this kind but also just with just  actresses on film real whatever real  life pornography not animated this is a  huge influence on young people growing  up and the difference between women and  men is that the men admit it if you  think women don't watch pornography and  aren't influenced by pornography they  are there are white women who learn  japanese and move to japan and for them  the main the main pornography they  watched growing up was japanese  pornography i can remember talking about  this with people this was in laos  specifically i'd never i just as it  happened i never talked about this  anyone in thailand or cambodia but  specifically in laos i remember talking  about the fact that look  you are growing up you know you're  developing and all the pornography you  watch is american  like don't you think this has political  and ethical and psychological occasions  like your whole concept of beauty and  this is laos  specifically  you are living in a country that was  bombed and destroyed by the american  army like the main thing in your history  you're dealing with is this country was  carpet bombed by america there are land  mines everywhere still from the american  war there were unexploded uh ordinance  bomb fragments so the the big tragedy of  your country is getting militarily  destroyed by america and you all watch  american porn like starting as teenagers  or whatever we're starting with children  all of you on your mobile phones have  american porn and american standard of  beauty american notions of romance and  kissing and and sex and everything this  is your this is your ideal you know  and uh  you know  in we can ask the same thing about white  people black people spending people in  the western world who are growing up  with japanese pornography japanese  sexuality japanese ideas about sex and  romance being this dominant influence in  their lives when they're teenagers when  they're young adults and in some cases a  lot of people do start watching  pornography as children and yeah eve but  even the ideas of of beauty of what is a  good looking woman or what is a  good-looking man being really shaped by  japan's number one export japanese  pornography so guys when you sit down in  a university classroom with people men  and women have chosen to study japan  these are two huge factors that involve  this kind of toxic nostalgia right this  is why they want to move to japan this  is why they want to learn japanese this  is a huge factor in their lives their  development when you sit down with  people who are studying tibet  doesn't exist when you sit down with  people who are studying cambodia uganda  any country in africa right it does and  maybe in the future it will maybe in the  future like just 10 years from now  hardcore pornography made in africa like  there are lots of good-looking women and  men in africa they're not running out of  good-looking people but maybe like the  filmmaking industry the point maybe  that's going to become the number one  download on pornhub but you can get the  statistics right now for how many of the  search terms and how many of the clicks  are for japanese porn it's a huge  dominant influence in the western world  the dominant influence in china within  asia too  today like for my generation for people  who are alive today talking about the  last 10 years the last 20 years whatever  japan has been in this status both  in you know video games manga anime  children's gym all the stuff cartoons  but also uh hardcore pornography they  have had a unique status in the world  that has that has these kinds of really  crazy knock-on influences for everyone's  lives long term yeah it was yeah no i  i guess that's part of why  the  concept of a weeaboo is insulting you  know or it just inherently is kind of  embarrassing to describe that way  that there's some sexual element to your  interest in japan  so that there's a sexual element  or right right no that there's a sexual  element to it or that there's a childish  element to it or or both  yes right i mean because even the  if you aren't interested in japanese  porn if you are interested in japanese  video games many of the japanese video  games uh are erotic you know and a lot  of the anime is erotic even if it's not  yes oh yes  pornographic it is you know that is  right and  look and just to be fair that would be  true if we were if we were having this  conversation in 1965  many detective movies made in america  were erotic many detective comic books  like it was it's about a detective  solving a murder mystery but actually  there's a lot of sexuality and sexy  women and like you know so we're not  being unfair the japanese but yes a lot  a lot of the manga a lot of the anime  even if it is not explicitly erotic in  the same sense it has a lot of erotic  content i i when i was learning japanese  i was there was i tried to look at  different cartoons where i could  actually practice the language  not a great method frankly but you know  i remember one and it was aimed at  children and the main character the male  protagonist was a child it was a small  child in school but they always had  these sexy adult female characters  standing around him and like even like  literally so like the camera there's a  cartoon it'd be on this guy he's like  knee-high but there's a woman in a skin  tight short skirt standing behind like  all the time he's interacting with these  sexy adult female characters there's  there's a lot of erotic on and joking  about sexuality and there would be  there'd be adult male characters who'd  be trying to seduce the female  characters there was a lot of erotic  messaging and a lot of information about  romance and adult sexual built into a a  japanese cartoon that was for  children you know the reason i was  watching i was literally sitting there  trying to practice now she didn't last  long in my life but you're doing  language exercises but yes these things  they can be laden with erotic messaging  and moral messaging and ethical  messaging yeah and we we currently don't  get that from saudi arabia we don't get  cartoons and children or video games we  don't get no nobody grows up playing  saudi video games we don't get that from  uganda or anywhere in africa i don't  know anyone who grew up with south  american culture that way the extent to  which it's even possible to grow up with  that kind of cultural influence from  germany or france or russia do you know  anyone who grew up watching a lot of  russian movies you know what i mean so  yeah this has been up to this point  uh a unique part of the the japanese  phenomenon and then yeah what happens as  you as you go on in life so in terms of  this pattern of of um  so yeah oliver says that's true of  french best band designer uh and so on  yeah but only within france that's all  i'm saying so it's quite similar oliver  what you say is quite true there are  people who grew up in france like that  and there are people who grew up in  spain i know that the the french erotic  comic books and so on they do get  translated into spanish there's a little  bit of cultural uh  bleeding over the border there whatever  a little bit but trust me nobody is  growing up in new york city or  california  influenced by french erotic comic books  nobody nobody's growing up in uh  australia influenced by french erotic  comic books whereas japanese is erotic  cartoons comic books it's a huge  influence in all those places that's all  yeah but no but that is true within  france french culture has that influence  and within germany german culture has  that influence you know no doubt but  what basically we're talking about  exporting to two other cultures yeah so  look in terms of this this cycle of  self-justification and of vindicating  your stupidity from one period of your  life with the stupidity of another  you know then what i see i mean i see it  in many of my fellow youtubers and so on  is exactly this insistence that video  games can still make you happy that the  anime can still make you happy that the  movie the comic book  um  and certain kinds of risk-taking sexual  activity can still make you happy of  wanting to cling to that wanting to  vindicate  the bad decisions you made in the past  by basically making the same bad  decisions again but with the delectation  of an adult person or of a middle-aged  person or of an older person you know um  instead of with the fear and trepidation  and ignorance of youth because as i said  there was a time if you can remember  back far enough there was a time when  this was terrifying most men if they  have if they're honest with you most men  will be able to tell you a story about  the fear and trembling they felt the  first time they bought a pornographic  magazine  today the internet has changed that but  just to walk up to the counter  and take the magazine and walk up to the  front what are they what are they going  to say to me what's going to happen you  know i mean most men that's a that's a  passage in life well guess what you can  still buy a porn mag today you can go  and buy one as a middle-aged person as a  foreigner you can't feel afraid anymore  the thrill is gone right and again you  can go hang around a bar or you can go  to a punk rock show or a rap show you go  to a musical event the fear is gone you  know and again i'm not saying it was  meaningful before and it's meaningless  now it was meaningless before it's  meaningless now  but you have to actively engage in this  kind of toxic nostalgia to try to  convince yourself this is something you  appreciate so yeah yeah for sure you  wanna okay  so i'm just catching up with your  comment guys if you have anything  intelligent to say say anything you want  to contribute to the conversation um now  is a good time to do it  you know it's funny too because um  very often  in talking about  how to overcome your own ignorance how  to overcome your own stupidity how to be  a less shallow childish person  very often even i recommend the people  that they go out and live in another  culture or learn another language  challenge themselves so you meet people  who are very sheltered you meet people  live their whole life in detroit and  have never been anywhere other than  detroit i once heard an interview i  think this was just on the radio it's  possible it was via youtube it was by  the internet but once you're an  interview with an inuit guy a guy who  was born and raised in the far far north  in the arctic circle so they cover a lot  of territory they knew it but he was  really from the far north even relative  to other anyway  and his life was so terrible growing up  and the big turning point in his life  was when he met a black guy and this  black guy got a job up there i forgot  what the job was it was gold mining or  what they're only a few jobs that take  you up to the architect like that  um he was a black guy from chicago or  something maybe he was from detroit  frankly i forgot but he's a black  american guy and he really took the time  to sit down and say that you know life  isn't like this everywhere like you  should really go  you know i know that sounds ridiculous  but you grew up in a place where there  were no trees like you've never seen  trees you know like you know you really  should get familiar with how different  life is  and you know in that guy's case he'd  grown up seeing a lot of alcoholism  not a lot of fresh vegetables too i'd  imagine meat and alcohol dominating life  so you know it's it's maybe a little bit  too easy to suggest to people you know  kind of go out and see the world and  it'll solve what's wrong with you i  think japan is even more disturbing to  talk about because when you when you  deal with  white people who've become japanophiles  um  again they don't have to be white you  could be hispanic and grow up in new  york city it could be black whatever  we're talking about western people as we  say western europe  north america and so on and they've  latched on to japan in this way what's  interesting is that they don't have any  of the advantages that come  from challenging your own preconceptions  getting out and and dealing with and  struggling with the alienness of a  foreign culture so and so forth they  don't have any of those benefits and  maybe that's because they only are  retrenching something something child  maybe it's because the extent to which  japan already is their culture and they  have nothing you know they've already  assimilated uh certain kinds of childish  and self-indulgent attitudes from  japanese anime movies and so on and so  forth i mean you know the other thing is  again see i'm saying this is easy for me  to say meaning it's not a great thing  for me to say it might be easy for me to  say to someone oh you know  go and do humanitarian work in cambodia  it's like go challenge your brigance  like get out of detroit really see a  different culture different set of  political problems by the way this comes  up a lot sorry just to put a human face  on this it comes up a lot with racism  i've talked to people including racist  people who are obsessed with the  difference between white people and  black people within the united states  within detroit or within uh  um  atlanta georgia you know atlanta in the  united states america you know they're  obsessed with the differences between  black people and white people within the  united states and they're so similar  like there's no  you know they literally they read the  same bible they speak the same language  like black people and white people in  the united states are so similar and  you're all messed up about this kind of  racist and racial politics narrative of  the woodland level and i say to them  like i'm being sincere like look have  you ever considered moving to cambodia  and really learning about the racism of  thai people against cambodians of  cambodian people against vietnamese  people and then within those categories  there's racism within cambodia they're  not one ethnicity the racism of  different groups against each other in  cambodia you know again i can say  obviously the racism within laos the  racism of the the hmong hmong the hamong  most people say but the racism of the  hmong against the oceans the races and  lotions against the hmong like you have  all these different units like and you  know when you're talking about  cambodia thailand vietnam laos and and  subcultures  these people have spoken different  languages continuously for a thousand  years they have different religions  different literature different values  they're really like they're really deep  really irreconcilable differences really  different systems of ethics like what  one group considers evil and other  considers good or permissible like  there's really profound  mutual hostility and misunderstanding  and alienation and and it's not the  difference between black and white and  it's not as simple as saying well this  group used to be enslaved by that group  it's in some cases it's everyone used to  be enslaving everyone you know like so  is that the history like well they all  used to enslave each other you know they  had all these wars or whatever like you  know it's it's easy to say people  criticize myself it might be a little  bit too easy to say look  maybe you could think about this in a  different way if you just went to a  foreign country studied a foreign  language really engaged with a foreign  set of  ethical and political challenges  but what you see with white people  learning japanese and white people  it's totally absent you see that there's  no benefit  at all  they get involved with things japanese  and i think it's just  this cycle of self-justification  uh toxic nostalgia vindicating the  stupidity of their own youth with the  stupidity of adulthood they're people  who grew up feeling that sonic the  hedgehog was the best thing ever and now  they're living in the homeland of sonic  the hedgehog they grew up feeling like  japanese pornography was the best thing  ever and now they're living in the  homeland of of japanese pornography and  that's certain kinds of ideas about sex  and romance and what have you and a lot  of it in japanese culture is centered  around high school girls i mean  i can't even say the japanese culture is  obsessed with college girls sadly a lot  of it is focused on high school girls  and you know now they're in the homeland  of  sexually objectifying and obsessing over  high school girls and short skirts and  and all the rest of this you know  so  you know for them  going to japan  is like plunging deeper  into the fatuous ignorance of their own  youth into the hyper self-indulgent you  know perspective on life you know they  they took over the so on and so forth  instead of challenging them in the way  that i've just described going to  cambodia could really challenge the way  you think about  racism and the way you think about  slavery and the way you think about  genocide and the way you think about  indigenous people all of those things  can be really profoundly challenging so  for the first time in a very long time  someone donated five dollars in the chat  thanks thanks very much guys there are  many ways to donate money to support the  channel and i i don't ask for it um the  last time i did a fundraiser  really with no questions asked my  supporters donated two thousand dollars  which i to say i appreciate it is  another statement it's just wonderful to  know people basically because i asked  for two thousand dollars people gave me  two thousand dollars that is amazing the  other thing i'd say is if you guys want  to spend one dollar and you really get  something out of it you know i do have a  patreon as you guys probably know but  you know my book is about one dollar  oh here i can give you guys the link to  the book review that's a good one um i  have your i think just three book  reviews uh they're about a paragraph  each um  you know another way to support the  channel and you're also buying something  for yourself the book is about one us  dollar it's i think it's exactly one  euro in europe i think it's 99 cents in  europe so it's about one euro in europe  um  uh as a kindle download and it's the  cost of paper it'll cost you about five  or six dollars to buy on paper so that  i i know i'll just be honest so far i've  made zero dollars out of the book it's  very likely i will continue to make  serious i think i will make no money of  it that's not what it's about but you  know if you want to show you support the  channel i would very much appreciate if  you took the time to read the book and  have put out an open call for questions  questions or comments or challenges to  what's in the boiling you can disagree  with what's in the book i'd like to make  a youtube video responding to some  intelligent um it could be a livestream  so  you know  the concept of support is nebulous but  if you want to click on that link i just  gave you guys um again obviously i  appreciate someone just donated five  dollars i but the truth is i don't  really need the five dollars what i need  you to do is read the book and i need  you to tell 10 of your friends what an  amazing book it is and how they should  read it and i have another book coming  out just a few weeks from now the  current book is only 100 pages long so  this is partly building hype and  interest before the next uh the next  book oh great question have you read the  orations by cicero so melissa do you  want to grab it off your oh oh you asked  me have you read the eurasian spice oh  oh oh yeah  what do you think of me what do you  think do you think i'm sitting around  playing mario 64 all day  um  so  totally off topic but cicero  was a terrible author and a terrible  person um  for most people  you would be better off if you could get  an intelligent book about cicero that  has quotations from cicero you know  rather than reading the primary source  for most people um i read the whole of  uh cicero's on the republic  um  so the title was translated in slightly  different ways but it's called something  like on the on the republic on the roman  republic etc i've read that whole thing  beginning to end wow it's badly written  it's really badly written  and i mean cicero's orations for most  people would be very boring very  difficult to read but are there are  there certain paragraphs of what cicero  said here and there that are important  yes of course and it's important you  know um  evidence um  politically and so on i i look i am not  a latin scholar i could imagine doing  that myself i could imagine um  putting together a book my own  quotations from cicero and and  discussion of the politics of philosophy  and so on i could imagine even doing  that because so there are interesting  things in there but boy as  uh  you gotta flip around that's the kind of  book where  reading it from cover to cover for most  people you know if you're an exception  i'm happy for you for most people hit  thumbs up by the way guys it's great uh  but you know i think there are three  people in the audience right now i  haven't hit thumbs up yet all right  anyway so thanks for the donation  but um  if you've got the time and the money for  one dollar that book is only 100 pages  long most people tell me they found it  very action-packed and they read it very  rapidly they told me it was a page  turner so regardless of how long it is  that they read it quickly and a lot a  lot of people i think the majority of  people who sent me an email or a message  about the book the majority said they  want to read it a second time that's  also interesting they said look i read  the book but i feel before i could talk  about it afterwards that's high praise  so they found it compelling and moving  but they had to go and read it now you  feel that way too much  [Laughter]  oh if you want sure yeah yeah  right so it took us a long time to get  it but that's oh what you want to model  this yeah  i just want to say i mean  this is it's  it would be an understatement to say  that this book is extremely meaningful  to me i was involved with some of the  editing of this book mostly just typos  because you know isil's brilliant there  were a few paragraphs that were  important yes yes i mean  it is an extremely important book in my  opinion and it's one of the most  important books written about veganism  well okay so i'll just say  the concept of an important book i'll  say this you know there's this old  quotation i i i tried it every once in a  while that you know um so okay if you  want the real quote you know mahatma  gandhi said um  there are some people so hungry that uh  the only way god can appear to them is  in the form of a loaf of bread  um i admit  you know  look put it this way  i would be fascinated to have a single  person right into me and say that they  felt that this book what it was talking  about had no relevance to their life i  haven't had that yet like every single  person who's read this book because they  know me and they know the channel they  know what the books oh yeah i still  resemble the portrait too  try to match them try to match the pose  it looks funny on screen having two  versions of my face um like every single  person who's read this book  has  so far has written to me saying wow this  is so relevant to what's going on in my  life and you know yes it's partly about  politics um but you know even the  pastors that are talking about marriage  and romance and stuff i have people  writing to me saying oh wow this stuff  you said about marriage and romance this  really hits home or this really is  relevant to their life so you know i've  had that kind of feedback about the  psychology and what says the stuff in  here about  motivation and being an artist being a  creative person and being an  intellectual i have people writing and  saying oh wow this is something really  relevant to my life okay but i'd be  interested to know like as i said you  know hey bread only tastes delicious if  you're hungry for it you know water  tastes like nothing if you're not  thirsty if you're there's enough maybe  maybe there's someone for whom this  isn't relevant and meaningful for your  life that'd be interesting to hear too  but yeah it's so far it's reaching the  people for whom the message is really as  melissa was saying like it's really  meaningful for her life it's for the  questions she's trying to answer oh  absolutely  yes i think it's meaningful for vegans  and i am interested to hear even from  people who are not vegan like just the  influence that it might have on them  because you know you know in effect this  is really important for vegans to hear  um right if you've been vegan for even  one year i think you're familiar with  all the frustration all the frustrations  of trying to explain to another person  why you're vegan and why this matters  and you know i just  right i just  just the the uh  the  not the incomprehension of why people  can't understand veganism right you know  this is  just the way that you talk about it but  my perspective is even more broadly why  people won't do the right thing just  because the right thing to do even when  they know it's the right thing yes like  that's why i think it goes beyond  veganism and i've talked to several  people so some people got in touch with  me from tokyo because the tico say i'm  controversy  but i said to them look i know you're  not vegan based on this conversation i  just had with you i think this would  still be really meaningful for you  because it's asking these questions  about how do you motivate people to  change how do you motivate people to do  the right thing is the right thing to do  like as an individual person and scaling  it up a society of millions i think this  is meaningful for you even if you're not  interested in veganism again  i'll be interested to hear if anyone  proves me wrong but i can imagine people  from a totally different political  school of thought with a totally  different set of political concerns yeah  responding to it that way too  yeah you want to say one masterpiece  thanks very sincere yeah  a lot of typos but  no no  you know i've i  i never completely finished it but  inside central asia more typos oh really  yeah  i used to work as a professional editor  so it'd be nice to be nice to imagine  the book had no typos but depending on  when you bought it each new edition has  fewer typos than before because the good  thing about amazon i'm able to go and  fix the typos  anyway but there were there were a few  tables in it reflecting the passion with  which it was written okay so getting  finally to this comment from joshua in  the audience who donated five dollars  um  quote studying the history of genocide  really gave me perspective on the world  i answered questions on quora about it i  used to edit wikipedia articles close  quote  well look you know so obviously i'm not  saying this to condemn you but you know  the problem with wikipedia  the problem with quora  is the absence of the first person  you know first person singular and my  mom asked me this about my writing  actually my mom is quite impressed with  the book i don't know how much she's  read she's probably read five pages or  10 pages no offense but i don't think  she's read a book but she my mom has  read some of my current writing she's  read  one chapter maybe of no more manifestos  maybe one half of one chapter by the way  my mom has read and she's really struck  by the style of writing too and she she  was asking like where did you get this  how did you develop this style of  writing but it is in large part a  rejection of academic writing is the  origin of my my style of writing  and  you know look it's really important so  you'll never get this in a peer-reviewed  article you'll never get this in a  wikipedia article and you'll never get  this in quora or this kind of you know  sanitized factual proportions it's  really poor important to write in the  first person  you know  when i first went to laos when i first  set foot on the mekong river  you know  these were my misconceptions  and this was the research i was doing  and here's what i understand today  and here's how i overcame those  misconceptions no of course it's great  to also have the other elements that you  might find in academic articles it's  great to present you know what what are  your sources how you to prove your case  to present your thesis or whatever but  that first person element is so  important  and it's so utterly lacking you know  from wikipedia and quora and  peer-reviewed  journal articles um  you know even if you just include so  we're talking about first nations  genocide even if you just include look  there was a time when i assumed this and  when i saw it this way but then i read  this book you know and again maybe and  then i realized this book was wrong and  i read these two other books whatever  the the process was you know i think  it's so important to include that first  person singular  autobiographical element and of course  this is part of why i do youtube and  part of why i do it in the way they do  one of the first videos i made this is  many many years ago i talked about the  fact look i am not going to dissimulate  an academic paper an academic essay you  know this kind of person that's not what  i want to do and you know i said look  i'm here to give it to you raw i'm here  to really keep it real this is when  keeping it real goes right you know what  i mean i and i'm here to really include  my own ignorance my own bias my own  passions  not as an end in itself not as a form of  self-indulgence or or ego exercise you  know but i think that's exactly how we  learn together you know we don't learn  by making mistakes we learn by noticing  them and nothing could be more precious  than sharing with others you know the  the mistakes you've made and how you  notice them and how you address them  which is very often the origin of those  that that kind of research you know so i  just say i mean i think nobody in my  audience has read my own father's  writing you know but my father also  wrote and published books none of my  father's books have a cover this good  let me  history of art and painting in canada  debatable you could say that's one book  that has a better cover than this the  history of art and painting again by  barry lord that's my dad my now deceased  dad  um  you know if you go back to even his  earliest writing like history the  history of art painting in canada  he is cheerleading for first nations  he's cheerleading for american indians  indigenous people it's cheerleading  but it's completely  hollow it's completely vapid you know  it's it's really completely insincere  and my father had already is pretty  quite a young man he had been involved  with first nations museums physiology  archaeology but you know archaeology has  connected to museums for the history and  preservation of indigenous people  um  so you know it wasn't out of out of  total ignorance but i knew him and you  can look at what he did with his life  and and what he what he valued it was  completely insincere you know  cheerleading for them and it's it's a  would be a very different thing for me  to present you know well look this is  what my parents told me about  genocide or indigenous people when i was  growing up this is what my school  teachers taught me and then this is the  research i did and this is you know and  these are the conclusions i came to and  this is my attitude now and this is this  is what i know and this is what i still  need to know like that's also an element  that's missing from wikipedia hey this  is what i'm still ignorant about you  know these things are often  interdependent you know what you don't  know  informs what you do know and how you  write about and talk about what you do  now i'm sorry central asia is a great  example of that by the way you know  how to what extent can you engage in the  cultural critique of china without being  aware of  politics history and culture of central  asia like that's a real question and  most people are totally ignorable and  they're they're connected they're  connected in every way like can we  engage in the cultural and political  critique of china while being ignorant  of of uh central asia and i know it's  well whether or not it's further away  it's debatable you know india and china  do have a land border they do abut one  another they do connect  by land  we nevertheless think of india and china  as being quite far away from each other  um uh because of the shape of the  countries involved and because of the  distance between beijing and new delhi  but not the distance between the the  extremities country you know many many  times i challenged scholars of buddhism  and just chinese people chinese  professors of politics of china politics  and  being like well yeah but you're  completely ignorant of what was  happening in india at the same time and  just even if it's just comparative  having that awareness and it's like look  what you so i can remember one professor  in particular i said this to uh you've  met him he's the guy who met you know i  remember saying to him yeah but what  you're saying about the history of  european imperialism in china makes no  sense if we just compare it to what was  going on  history of imperialism in india like if  you just include your ignorance about  one is informing what you're saying  about the other even if you you know  something about the other so yeah that's  that's a tremendously important part  of writing and talking and learning and  teaching about history about politics  and about life a lot of we talked about  in this video is just  just life merely life  as if life itself were of a lower of a  lower priority okay hard-hitting  questions from the audience someone asks  quote what is your favorite ice cream  no  so guys i am not an ice cream person i'm  really not it's not that i intensely  hate ice cream but i have mentioned it  several times even before i was vegan i  was not an ice cream person uh now i am  vegan so we did recently uh try a new  vegan ice cream but really melissa is  the ice cream person  melissa do you want to do you want to  keep it private or do you want to tell  the public do you have an answer i don't  ever ask you we've had flavor  do you have if well maybe you don't have  a favorite maybe it's not something you  have one  well yeah yeah  it might not be it might not be  something you can answer that sense  like i usually just go for vanilla but  i'm looking for specks of vanilla you  know also that style the actual okay so  you want you want the black flame  vanilla yeah yeah yeah yeah so intense  no but i will point out to you so we  also have experience being in the south  of france with italian ice cream oh  right  you see oh see now it gets complicated  so yeah that and that stuff's vegan so  when you had mango ice cream and that  kind of stuff again with no no dairy in  it yes so in that case because right so  it's like a sorbet right yeah i guess i  would have to say uh raspberry raspberry  sorbet  see see how hard it is  anyway yes there you go deep deep  question but you know the truth is i i  am just really not a uh  i am just really not an ice cream person  so i'm not the person to ask that for  that particular  uh  question  oh wow so we have some well-read people  in the audience random dude says quote i  think john adams read it in the original  language so random dude if you read no  more manifestos my book that's coming  out next there's quite a lot of critique  of john adams and i'm sorry to tell you  this but i think john adams was really  lying about most of the stuff you read  um was a really strange character i mean  john adams was a really really crazy guy  but the extent to which he and his whole  generation were pretending to have  knowledge of ancient greek and latin  sources and did not really understand  what they were reading is one thing and  then the extent to which john adams in  particular was really an insane  malevolent person who was constructing a  bizarre fiction about the history of  politics in europe that's that's another  john adams a really dark character once  you get to know him um i'm currently  reading this book called 13 clocks and  it promises that later it's going to get  into john adams a bit but he was so john  adams  and benjamin franklin they were really  the most influential  people writers authors generators of  ideas and the years just leading up to  uh the american revolution and of course  that's partly due to luck um john adams  published just the right book and just  the right essays just the right time but  he he was very influential that time  nobody reads his writing today but i do  not feel um  i do not feel any guilt in saying that  the writings of john adams about  democracy are both evil and insane  and  why would i say guilt so by contrast you  know  the first draft of my book my book no  more manifestos the first draft said  some very negative things about governor  morris so governor morris is another  historical figure involved in writing  the constitution he literally wrote the  constitution it was his penmanship so he  was involved with drafting the  constitution and debating its content  but also writing it  um he had good handwriting  uh governor morris in the first draft i  was uh  very harsh very i was condemning him  and i do feel guilty about it and i'm  the final draft it will be more  understanding a more nuanced view of  governor morris but my view of uh john  adams is very very negative so sorry  digression from the topic of this video  talk about nostalgia in relation to the  american constitution toxic nostalgia  and the uh and the american constitution  i appreciate uh appreciate the comment  someone who knows who john adams is and  knows his his claim uh  uh too so someone said some negative  comments about uh mohandas gandhi i have  an incredibly negative view of honda's  gandhi my long-term viewers know that so  i'm not reproaching you for this but uh  this viewer you're probably unaware of  that in the past i've made videos with  in-depth discussion and critique and  frankly condemnation of gandhi  um  if you want to jump right to the chase  there's a famous article  harshly condemning gandhi that was  published in commentary magazine so  probably if you just search for those  two things mohandas gandhi and  commentary magazine put commentary  magazine and quotation marks uh from  from google you will get a very harsh  condemnation of ghani which it's famous  it's remained famous for  for decades and it includes discussion  about his sex life and his  totally insane religious views about  which i mean views that were considered  insane by other members of the hindu  faith at that time yeah so yeah  long story short gandhi was a bad guy  and i have made other youtube videos  talking about it it's come up certainly  in vegan activism many times  so a comment here about the youtube  algorithm  i do not believe in the youtube  algorithm i mean there's a very real  sense in which i do not believe it  exists  when you look at my youtube channel  today  the number of views i get on things  largely reflects you know it's human  behavior the level of human interest how  many people actually click on something  that is what you're looking at and you  know um obviously in some ways that is  humbling and humiliating and  disappointing and what can i tell you  it'd be it'd be nice to imagine i think  people do live with this self-justifying  view that there's a huge audience  interested in their work and that  audience isn't able to find their work  because of the youtube algorithm i do  not believe that at all i think that's a  real self-justifying  self-mystifying lie people live with uh  anyway i just put a post on my on my  patreon  um to an old video i made about sam  harris and i think they got about 4 000  views from memory so it's not that that  uh  fresh in my mind but you know  me  sitting on camera  insulting sam harris criticizing his  writing to some extent it's a it's an  intelligent critique but it's also but  it also contains me really cussing the  guy out really saying this guy is an  idiot yeah sorry so looks like it's a  stupid video it's an intelligent video  but it's also entertaining because i'm  really i'm really being quite uh  insulting and and cruel and stating just  how stupid and wrong stan perez is  well you know you could sit there and  feel sorry for yourself and say oh this  should have one million viewers or  something and there's another view  that's appreciative and say wow isn't it  amazing that 4 000 people  uh managed to manage to watch this video  i made about sam harris  when you are giving advice that nobody  wants to hear nobody wants to hear sam  harris is an idiot he has his fans  you know  you know how many thousand people do you  think you could reach that and again  i've got to compare myself to um  uh  i got to compare myself to my own  university professors i don't think any  of uh just be real with you think about  all the people i've known with phds  could they make a 15-minute monologue on  a topic an intellectual topic a  political topic and reach just 4 000  people so it's it's amazing and i can't  blame any algorithm i don't think about  these things  and look if you think it's tough working  with the so-called  youtube algorithm if you think it's  tough to reach 4 000 people  with a hard-hitting  disquieting intellectually challenging  message on youtube how about reaching 4  000 people with a book  how about a pamphlet how about the  written word okay  it's hard and for most people it's  impossible and by the way it is a proven  fact the way sam harris got  famous was because of the wealth of his  parents he had multi-millionaire parents  and his parents were uniquely well  connected in hollywood so they had  hollywood agents and book agents and so  on and they made him into a celebrity uh  through very cynical means well if your  parents are multi-millionaires with  connections in hollywood or connections  and  the marketing and advertising and  publishing world in new york that's  another thing but the vast majority of  people would never be able to write a  book that reaches just 4 000 people  that's that's really hard and i'm out  here hustling  it's great that 4 000 people watch that  video it would really mean a lot more to  me and really mean a lot more to you me  more the audience and the readers if 4  000 people read the book i already  published let alone the next the next  one i'm about to publish  um  but that's hard so yeah it's easy to  complain but guys if you even compare  getting four thousand views on youtube  to having four thousand listeners on a  podcast  whoa you ha  podcasts they keep the numbers secret  right good luck figure out how many  listeners listen to a podcast that's  that's really hard and then there is no  algorithm right there is no interface  like this  for for podcasts a small number of  podcasts are very successful of course  and reach millions of years but the vast  majority of people doing these podcasts  they're reaching a tiny tiny tiny  audience to get beyond your circle of  friends and family with a podcast  is really tough again unless your family  are multi-millionaires or you're  connected to the movie industry or the  tv industry or or something like that or  can pay for an advertising budget but  look even by the way look at the  struggle of ben shapiro's sister  who is considered a beautiful woman in  our times whether or not she is to your  taster to my face she was considered an  amazingly beautiful person so that's  someone who was already famous already  considered extremely attractive already  had a huge audience because of her  brother's fame and she really struggled  she paid for a lot of advertising she  struggled to get just a few thousand  viewers on her channel where she talks  about being a right-wing conservative  orthodox jewish  mother  this is her you know her message so no  it's it's not easy but as hard as it is  on youtube you got to calibrate your  expectations because guys  okay what's easier i reached four  thousand people with a message what if i  got a phd and then i pay a ton of money  to get a phd then pay a ton of money to  present a paper at a conference it's so  depressing you know you present a paper  at a conference maybe there are two  people in the audience who are  interested in hearing the paper like  maybe there are eight people in the  audience but others are there because  they have to be for the conference you  know but seriously and i've talked to  people with phds they know about that  it's like they paid for an airplane  ticket they paid a couple hundred  dollars in conference fees they paid for  a hotel room they put all this work into  writing this paper they had to get a phd  in the first place then you stand there  at the podium you read this and nobody  cares and nobody wants to hear it and  maybe if you're lucky it gets peer  reviewed and published in you know  and then rots and a dead dead hole you  dead end of the internet you know a lot  of them don't even print on paper  anymore you know so it's just it's a pdf  somewhere on the internet that people  have to pay hundreds of dollars to  access if they're not at an institution  they can't even get it through google  right it's off limits and nobody ever  sees their hard work it never reaches an  audience so youtube is a lot better than  that and there's no there's no algorithm  involved with peer-reviewed uh  peer-reviewed publications just one  really brief answer about that i made a  youtube video that reached several  thousand people sorry i think definitely  more than three thousand i forgot to  reach five thousand so you know a little  bit so let's say three thousand though  uh to be conservative but i made a video  that reached several thousand people  and it included a link  to a peer-reviewed paper which like i  say as a pdf on the internet somewhere  in this case it's unusual because it's a  free journal so you don't have to be a  member of the university library you  don't have to pay 500 or 200 to access  it it was free for anyone to  and i get an downl of appreciation from  the author of the the pdf the academic  article and it was so sad that the the  editor of the journal had sent him an  email and this is forwarded to me saying  hey well this is really great  look at how many people clicked and  downloaded the article and unlike our  normal readers these clicks they're from  all over the world like some of them are  from brazil some of them from china i  have viewers all over the world  it's  like 15 people  one of five like 15 people had  downloaded and for them this was  exciting hey wow 15 people in a week  read this article or at least download  it maybe they didn't even read it they  just clicked on it right  like  so yeah um  you know this is in some ways similar to  the discussion of nostalgia  the algorithm is not an algorithm the  algorithm is a self-justifying mentality  uh people intelligent and you know maybe  it's hard to accept only 4 000 people  are interested in watching that video  it's a great video it's a very  entertaining video as well as an enter  as well as uh  intelligent and informative and  important video it has a political point  and a moral points i may feel it's a  really great video but  just accepting maybe there were only  four thousand people in the world  interested in this  yeah  yeah i will just say i've had to think  about this too because you know on a  personal level  there's a certain amount of truth to the  statement that like you know your  influence on my life has has totally  transformed how i see the world and i  cannot imagine  any other channel having had that  influence on me um so in a in a sense i  i think to myself being like how is this  how is your channel not more successful  but um  you know  then i i just i think of  your your book as well  you know i i don't want to keep raving  about how important your book is and how  much  i really value the information but you  know also just thinking about like you  may not think that there are issues with  the vegan movement you may not think  that there are issues um you know you  may feel that you are doing the best you  can and and so on but like i just i i  really appreciate that your videos are  constantly  pointing out what's wrong because it's  it's  because i live with you you know every  day i am i am thinking  you know i have this exposure  to all these issues you know uh you know  you talked about yeah when we listen to  the news you know you think  maybe we should just move there you know  with the situation  like let's go there you know  i'm always living with this influence so  i i don't want to  forget that or take it for granted yeah  you know but most people who know you  they know you through your youtube  channel yeah they don't live with you  kind of they have a little bit of that  information oh i mean like i i feel so  lucky and fortunate to be always like  inspired by you and and living with that  influence but right like you know your  book your channel like this is  influencing people in a way  and then you wish there were a million  other people  i do yes i really do because  i am living with that too where i just  think you know we don't have time to  waste uh well look i just wanna your way  of phrasing it here which is totally  valid and true is to point it out in  terms of critique of what's wrong and in  terms of not having time to waste but  the other thing i point out this is true  even if there's conversations where i  talk about us moving to nepal you know  we're talking about some random things  yeah uh moving to puerto rico and  talking about it's a shout these are  shallow examples there are deeper  examples we talk about but you know  that's actually not critique  that's talking about aspirations and  possibilities and being motivated to  look to the horizon i think that's  something people are lacking in their  lives and that's something my youtube  channel offers yes and the book offers  and the the live streams and the  podcasts  yeah i would be interested to hear if  like you know if you have a different  opinion but like  the criticisms that i have heard of of  your content in general your youtube  videos um you know some some of what i  hear is that it's uh too negative but i  like i have not been more inspired i  know i know there's all this stuff done  yeah i mean there is a lot of dumerism  there is a lot on the internet where you  can listen to something and feel totally  discouraged or like also your own family  in detroit like you'll speak people just  don't think anything's possible  anything's better is enough yes exactly  yeah um you are constantly saying saying  you know you should be dissatisfied with  the status quo and what you are you're  dissatisfied with your own mediocrity be  disaster of the mediocrity of the  society or the evil of the society  you're living right yeah yeah and then  you're in for something but you know  that's also because that's what i would  want as a viewer that's what i would  have wanted as a younger man it's still  what i want now is that  looking to that further horizon looking  to those positions yeah so you guys may  not know this there is this well-known  phrase in english it's an idiom in  english uh politics is the art of the  possible now i'm emphasizing that it's  an idiom in english because if you look  back at what the german was it has been  creatively translated and reinterpreted  from the original german uh statement  but politics is the art of the possible  okay  possibility in the sense of what's  possible is something we have to imagine  and assert for ourselves right and even  within the remit of this video right  like okay why do people cheat on their  wives and collect video games and stuff  a lot of people have never thought  through  the possibility of leading a better life  and like talking about stories people  are still making comments about first  nations people genocide you know and so  i understand a lot of people have never  thought about the possibility of knowing  more than their school teachers knew  knowing more than their university  professors knew reading books and  gaining a level of acumen and expertise  gaining it themselves not relying on  someone else you know let alone doing  humanitarian work or doing something  political to change the world like they  they have just never even thought hey  you know what i could take six months  out of my life and and really focus on  this and it could change the rest of my  life like i'd have a project doesn't  have to take 10 years i could work hard  to learn the history of the korean gym  or any other example and you know  like oh and there could be another  research project of that you know i i  was raised with a lot of [ __ ] about  the vietnam war what if i took six  months to really research you know  really challenge my understanding of  vitamins just a random example whatever  sin jam central asia all kinds of stuff  myanmar whatever could be a whole series  of things but like once you start  getting into the active research  informed opinion mentality you know and  when you are challenging yourself i can  do something about this i'm not  powerless if i don't like  the political history of haiti i can  change it you know and at a cost at a  price if you choose to get involved with  the politics of haiti you're choosing  not to be involved with the politics of  detroit or japan or something else like  you you can't be everywhere doing  everything you can't learn every  language you got to commit to one millia  and one method then we start to get to  the cost of that but like instead of  being in a position of powerlessness and  passivity to live with because again if  politics is the art of the possible i  know this isn't the meaning it's not the  original german is special it's not what  they mean so we're creatively  reinterpreting the phrase like you know  really the meaning of what was said was  german is like in politics you do what  you may do what you manage to do you  know you do what you meant you get by  with what's possible but i'm talking  about you know mentating and visualizing  and thinking about  what is possible pressing into the realm  of things unimaginable to you things you  never thought about before oh oh i could  you know i could move to cambodia i  could learn the cambodian language hey  this this isn't my problem i could make  it my problem i was raised with these  lies about genocide but i can you know i  can do better whatever it is you know  and instead people really live very  often this this small shallow remit of  familiar pleasures whether that's  watching sports on tv or going skiing or  watching anime or playing video games so  i just say i i totally agree with what  you said and you put the emphasis on the  critique  sure there's plenty of critique on this  channel and on telling people not to  waste their time and not to waste their  lives but there's also a positive  element there and of really really  saying to you look there there is an  endless horizon there you're not looking  at like you have your you're looking  down at your own feet and if you just  look up for a minute and start thinking  about the next five years is that oh i'm  saying maybe you can't do it today but  just think about a five year window what  you can accomplish who you can be and  where you can be living and the  difference like  yeah  yeah i will relate it back to what i was  talking about earlier with this this  conversation with my father about doubt  and how you know his perspective is that  if you spend too much time doubting and  worrying about things that this is just  an inherently negative thing um but what  i appreciate is just you know to me it  was natural to worry to me it was  natural to feel  something that's wrong with the society  that i was raised in and like you said  earlier i mean yes i'm i'm [ __ ] up  about the history of slavery and  genocide in america  rather than feeling calm and  self-assured and confident  yeah i know it's oh it's fine it's  normal yeah there's plenty of that this  is just how it is right  don't question it don't think about it  don't worry about it all right no i i  worry i i can't yeah worry and grow wise  but it's not necessarily that you have  to be you know living in fear or you  know that that uh  you know that there's just no hope for  the future  that there can be something positive  about doubt and living with doubt right  right but look also i just want to give  it a very powerful example  this idea that confidence is a is better  than so what if you just signed up and  joined the army like you thought about  it you researched it you worried about  it okay you've made the decision to not  join the army but like what it would be  better  to just  just join the army without thinking like  you know and again we could sit about  any job we said about being a nurse too  or something  no worry about it might you think it all  the way through i've known plenty of  miserable nurses people who hated and  regretted the decision  i also knew people who studied nursing  and then never did the job because they  knew they hated it so much by the time  they finished getting the nursing degree  well you spent all these years of your  life and all this money learning to  become a nurse now you're never going to  work as a nurse you know okay  so yeah no do you do your worrying in  advance so on and so forth yeah anyway  but coming back to the initial point you  know  um instead of blaming the algorithm  instead of doing that that kind of  self-justification you know my point is  i really accept  that what i have to say is profoundly  unpopular and it's only ever going to  reach a small audience  and you know when i calibrate what do  you mean by a small audience it's  enormous compared to the people i knew  with phds i've already described that  who had to pay to fly to a conference  you know  and i mean like literally even what i  have to say about buddhism  i'm reaching a larger audience  of people who are really interested and  really willing to listen  than i could have ever reached by  getting a phd in buddhism and presenting  papers at those conferences because let  me tell you then you're presenting a  paper to an audience that is  they're ideologically committed to not  hearing what you have to say another  interesting comparison would be  communism you know like what you can and  can't do getting a phd in academia and  trying to talk about communism by the  way i'm anti-common yeah  because the people you're presenting the  papers to they're committed on the other  side of that or whatever yeah right and  yeah what will reach  more people you know  an academic paper that you would write  right  which is inherently an anti-communist or  the videos that you have made right you  know  but people who are willing to listen  because i mean too i know i'm still  ridiculous you can in theory have a book  that's bought by a lot of people but  they don't really read it they don't  really it's not you know it's not really  impacting people but you know have that  there anyway um  yeah  so you know  look both are hard it's hard to create  content  you know  for an audience that's narrow but deep  to recognize okay a small number of  people are going to deeply appreciate  this it's going to mean a lot to a small  number of people it's also hard to make  content for a huge audience but where  it's incredibly shallow it doesn't  really matter to any of them and if you  die or you cease to exist they're going  to turn to someone else for their  popcorn if you're a popcorn vendor and  you reach millions of people with  popcorn well yeah but this has nothing  to do with you if you die tomorrow  someone else makes the popcorn who cares  you know you are replaceable because the  shallow shallowness of your of your  content  and i have known a couple people on  youtube who are in that situation  not  any names where they're aware of the  shallowness of what they do and they're  somewhat self-loathing about it even  though they reach a much larger much  larger audience than i than outreach  okay but thanks i understand the only  other thing i'd say is you you do have  to find fault with yourself in part  because part of what you're saying this  isn't everything you said but part of  what you're saying is this is so  meaningful to me therefore it should be  meaningful to everyone else and that  that's the kind of issue this book  credit this is really let's say no no  let's examine that assumption no what's  meaningful to you what's meaningful you  isn't meaningful to other people and  let's really talk about that let's  really deal with that let's deal with  like that like not as a minor footnote  but it's a major crisis in life that you  have to face up to and look at so it's  not just veganism veganism  guess what cambodia  is meaningful to me the political  history of cambodia in a way that it  never was meaningful to my own father  it never was meaningful to any of my  brothers or sisters you don't know my  father had a lot of kids i have a lot of  brothers and sisters like the same  generation as me and the odds are  the political history of cambodia will  never matter to my daughter the way it  used to be right like that's a safe bet  right so you know the point is obviously  you scale it up i've been sitting in a  [ __ ] university classroom full of  people who pretend they're interested in  cambodia like i've been in situations  like that and you face up to the  depressing reality guess what  cambodia doesn't matter to them by the  way that speaker even though they've  like signed up for some university  before they're supposed to be there now  look we could say this again about china  ooh japan oh all these things it gets  more depressing and we could say this  about africa and all kinds of things but  you know the point is it's not just  veganism and it's not some minor  footnote to your these this problem it's  a major fundamental philosophical crisis  you have to face up to in life and i get  it like okay the point is this  if a certain rapper on the internet is  your favorite rapper if a certain  guitarist is your favorite guitarist and  you feel like gee  why is it i'm the only person to  appreciate like he only has a few dozen  fans you know i understand that it  brings a certain tension in your life  like well gee i wish more people could  appreciate this guy's guitar work i wish  more people could appreciate you know uh  you know  appreciate his music whatever it is that  that you feel you appreciate and other  people don't appreciate you know um  okay  but i mean what melissa is saying is  this philosophy these considerations on  politics etc uh that this has been a  really major positive life-changing  thing for her and again for some people  that's going to be  look  ancient athens  ancient rome why isn't the study of  democracy in ancient athens meaningful  for you and you and you the way it is  for me why isn't thucydides meaningful  for you the way to speak well it isn't  like you got to really deal with that  you can't reproach or people or complain  about it like there's something wrong  with you because you aren't capable of  appreciating how important and  meaningful the study of democracy in  ancient greece is well they can't and  they won't you know it's not going to  change and and guess what you are a  minority within a minority within a  minority and you will be forever whether  we're talking about veganism caring  about ethics ecology and politics in  that way or caring about democracy  whether it's history democracy the  present future  caring about the future of democracy in  china myanmar cambodia caring about  democracy even within the united states  of america guess what you are in a tiny  minority that is fundamentally defined  by that slippery word  care you're in a self-defining minority  of people who care and when you care  you challenge your own ignorance when  you care you learn and you keep on  learning when you care you struggle and  strive to make a difference even when it  seems hopeless and you can't make a  difference it seems like you can't help  first nations people it seems like you  can't help the people of haiti he seems  like you can't help people cambodia but  you care  so you learn and you keep learning you  live and you keep living and you're not  watching sports on tv or playing video  games because you care and you again  it's very easy to say as moses said i  wish  tens of thousands of people or i wish  millions of people would also appreciate  this book or also appreciate this  youtube channel but it is not a minor  thing to face up to how terrible i said  no  you know the vast majority of people are  nev even if they listen to this message  even if you play it over a loud speaker  you know they uh as we say in american  time they ain't trying to hear it like  you can expose them to this they're  never going to appreciate it they're  never going to understand it it's never  going to change their lives away to  yours and i brought that up in the  recent tequila sam video where i talked  through look tko sam  how much intellectual development would  you have to go through so that you could  appreciate and respond to thucydides you  know philosophy and politics formation  athens generally so that this book could  be as meaningful for you as it was for  me right because again it's not just  that you're ignorant enough that the  book is telling you something you want  to hear or the book is telling something  you need to hear no it's also that  you're sophisticated enough you're  already asking the questions you're  already dealing with the doubts that  this book  partially addresses corresponds to you  know  all right guys good moment to put in any  any questions or comments you have  great question from the audience is this  your girlfriend  do you think i'm paying a model to come  on camera i should i should i should pay  a series of models off of model mayhem  to come onto my live streams and spice  things up right here  now she's she's an independent book  reviewer that would be interesting pay  pay one of the booktubers  uh i actually i think i wrote to two  booktubers about that but i never found  anyone on booktube doing uh nonfiction  or doing politics but it would be cool  even if i had to pay for it to pay  another uh booktube channel to read and  review the book universe i'd be  interested if someone critiqued it or  someone who didn't appreciate it on  pinterest to hear that you know but  someone who really read the book  seriously in christmas i don't mean  someone just in a shallow way you know  glances of the first few pages in  response that would be interesting here  too  anyway  great coming from the audience iowa says  get a high-end game or chair that is the  secret  there's a very 2022 comment it didn't  used to be like that people didn't use  still be in gamer chairs back in 2016.  it's now become so common this  particular style of chair  oh here's  somebody says they're reading cicero in  the original latin  and  uh  oliver says salist is better than cicero  so i would i would agree with that i do  think status is more more interesting  than cecile but in all those cases i  think you get a very strong sense of the  author's character uh coming through the  writing  i don't know i don't know if all  roman literature is like that but i  think everything i've read from rome was  like that they were certainly not scared  to speak in the first person and to have  their own sense of character and  morality and perspective uh come through  in their in their mind  so rogam silva asks um quote isil do you  have any interest in the indigenous  people of brazil like the tupi gorarni  well yeah i did to some extent  i mean look i don't know how much i want  to talk about just just  don't want to bore the audience but of  course when i was in first nation  studies indigenous studies this kind of  thing  there was work and there was reading i  was doing mostly looking at parallels  and contrasts so to what extent are  those languages destroyed by christian  missionaries to what extent are the  indigenous languages of south america  actually preserved by christian  missionaries because both happened  christianity destroys them but then they  also translate you know the christian  bible into indigenous languages and it  becomes the language of the church and  like you know and um  comparison of the political struggles so  you know there are different kind of  indigenous movements in in all of south  america central america south america  and so on and which are the more  successful which are the more which are  failed and what have you uh so yeah i  mean yes it's something i have read  about something i have been interested  in um  you know have i ever considered you know  moving to brazil permanently for that  reason or moving to colombia or anywhere  else at the moment  no it didn't seem to me to make sense  because there are so many people who are  already fluent in spanish and to work on  any of those languages or any of those  political stories you first need to do  spanish and then work with the  indigenous language and also you know i  hate christianity  [Laughter]  um that's you know  for me and how i spend my time  uh it would be very difficult to put  myself into such an intensely christian  context  um  most most christians hate me too  so yeah i mean they're just different to  bears there was like well somebody else  should should do this uh but yeah it is  interesting there are some indigenous  languages indigenous peoples in south  america who are not on the brink of  total extinction whereas in north  america all of them they either are  extinct or they're on the brink of  extinction in terms of their languages  and culture and so on and that's that's  dealing with but you know and it may be  that in the future there's a real  anti-christian discourse that grows out  of that in in south america but not yet  that's so dominated by christianity that  for me personally that'd be very very  depressing and hard to deal with and you  know i have alternatives just to give a  contrast you know i really seriously  considered it several times my life  specializing in mongolia  in some ways mongolia is a horrible  place to study you can see some scraps  of that in the internet some of my  writing about politics in mongolia um  well mongolia is not dominated by  christianity nor by islam this way so  maybe more more rewarding for me um  given given that i have a choice but  yeah i mean it's you know and  all of these places also i mean mongolia  and the indigenous people of south  america communism is also a huge issue  communism and anti-communism and  democracy and anti-democracy so yeah  there are a lot of issues there that are  interesting to me and and there's been  reading i've done about it and so on and  melissa and i for a long time were  promoting this book well it's not anyway  we did some book reviews related to that  too i'll leave it at that  because i've talked about enough in the  past and it's enough right  so one person in the audience says quote  i admit i feel quite tempted by the  prospect of doing humanitarian work in  laos whenever you talk about it  this could be a separate video i'll  reply to that just one sec one second  questions about why we like salast so  much how can you ask me why i said i  think as a joke to the same person but  i've made the joke i think to to oliver  that i want to get a hat  that says m-a-r-s  make america read salust again  you know as this is my my slogan make  america read salast how can you ask me  what i like about salas oh most is  getting sour stuff whatever it doesn't  matter  yeah it's a terrible cover there you go  compared to this cover i look real  handsome right  here we have make make america read  salas again that's one of my uh and what  which one has a better cover guys  i have a better cover than salas um  anyway to say this to clouds um so i  don't know if you have any experience  with southeast asian languages or what  have you  well i have a lot of regrets in life  but i'll say this about humanitarian  work with laos  humanitarian work with cambodia and  humanitarian work with myanmar  uh instead of being like jumping off a  cliff  you know like a sudden absolute  commitment  all three of those can be a kind of  gradual relatively safe process of  acclimatizing yourself because they have  thailand in the middle  so to give an example  you can become fluent in laotian  and you can become well informed about  what's going on in lao politics  without crossing the border into laos  remaining in the adjacent part of  northeastern thailand where an enormous  number of lotion people live an enormous  amount of people are back and forth  across the border and let's say you have  a job as a bank teller in america like a  pretty steady job you can be doing that  flying back and forth you don't have to  tell anybody what you're doing you don't  have to explain what you're doing you  can be preparing to do humanitarian work  you know this would also be drove  archaeology or it could be some other  kind of project you could be learning  the language learning the politics um  staying within the political limits of  of thailand now again some people will  accuse you of being a cia agent or a spy  and that's some ways the life i'm  describing it's kind of similar to  espionage you're preparing and learning  the language and learning the politics  learning what's really going on and on  both sides of the border the reality of  what's going on a lot of it is secret a  lot of it has certainly never been  written down in english but even if you  were searching the internet in thai or  in lotion you're not gonna find  written accounts of what's going on  politically you know as it unfolds from  what i was saying going to say for  current history but you want to know  what was going on in laos in the 1980s  what are you going to read in english or  in laosh really what's what's ever been  published about laos in the 80s and that  laos in the 1990s so a lot of it is de  facto secret even if people are willing  to talk about it verbally it's only  accessible through verbal uh tradition  you can say exactly the same thing i  could repeat myself with cambodia  exactly the same thing about uh myanmar  you know and it's all you know and it's  all a little bit dangerous that's also  why i say people think you're a cia  agent just learning the language  learning the politics and and again you  might also be interested in learning  some of the legal  details like how you're going to  actually incorporate a charity and get a  post office box and be able to receive  mail and you know so there's paperwork  too you want to be learning about you  know how you're going to create some  kind of foundation  some post office boxing um so that you  can receive donations or do whatever it  is you want to do but with those  countries you can do it over several  years  and you can spread out you cannot risk  your life you cannot  really take the risks i took i did i did  risk my life i was in  i was in very difficult circumstances  while having a job in the united states  you can make you can make that  transition  you know  if you want to be involved in syria  right now humanitarian work or whatever  you want to call it  it's not going to be gradual it's not  going to be easy it's not going to be  safe like that there isn't the  equivalent of thailand adjacent to syria  what there is is jordan right you know  what do you know it's just as dangerous  it's just as nice i mean sorry what's  adjacent is turkey do you want to be out  in the part of turkey that's on the  syrian border right now that's that's  probably even more dangerous you really  get killed you know  um like a lot of these areas there isn't  a safe haven right next to it where you  can work on the language and learn  what's going on politically really  learned the ropes over over several  years i mean now right now i think all  kinds of things are possible with with  ukraine i wouldn't discourage you about  ukraine but again you have to think  carefully i mean can you put in a foot  before you put in a whole leg or before  you have both feet in and you have no  home anywhere else this is this is your  your whole life and look so i was gonna  say i do have um  regrets about this in different ways but  you know one of them obviously is  um  just the ease of the language you know  chinese is so hard the chinese language  is so hard  and i'm aware i could be totally fluent  in lotion today to honesty i think i  feel that way about burmese too  burmese seems so easy now now that  you've done chinese you know i did all  these other languages too i did pali i  did you know we worked on greek for a  while hebrew you know um  you know obviously  any language is a lot of hard work just  learning spanish is hard work just  learning french it is i'm not minimizing  that  but  proficiency  in  spoken lotion  is attainable proficiency in spoken  burmese is attainable  and i mean you know advanced literacy  reading and writing in those languages  is so much more attainable than than  chinese so obviously there's always a  little bit of regret in me just like  well  you know  like so i'm now 43 years old how well am  i going to be able to read chinese when  i'm 53 like i have doubts guys like i i  really have doubts will i be able to  read a newspaper in chinese when i'm  when i'm 53  maybe  you know like it's it's only maybe but  with a language like laotian or a  language like burmese it doesn't have to  be maybe you can really once you start  working on it you'll feel very certainly  the um you know that you can attain  advanced  speaking ability and so on and so forth  and then um  yeah you know as i say getting general  occasionally political civil states so  yeah that's interesting i think that's  the first person ever who said that to  me  that they're they're uh  they're tempted  by the thought of doing humanitarian  work in laos  um  yeah  it's a hell of a thing to look at  someone else's tragedy  and try to make it your own it's a hell  of a thing to look at someone else's  suffering and uh and try to make it your  own you know and i think that is one  part of the desire to make the world a  better place but it's it's not the only  part as soon as you get to laos and  start helping these people you're gonna  figure out that a large percentage of  them as soon as you help them  they just want to get drunk  they just want to get drunk and eat meat  and ruin the environment and live a  totally reckless  self-centered self-indulgent lifestyle  they want they want to live like jake  paul to be quite honest you know um you  know you're gonna realize that a lot of  the people you're helping are horrible  people you know uh so on and so forth so  you know your good intentions this this  comes back to themes dealt with in this  book i think it's dealt with no more  manifestos too but it's really  especially this book but you know the  fact that  i can have good intentions  and i can help you but i can't have good  intentions for you right and my helping  you won't transfer my good intentions to  you right you guys can visualize this  easily enough if you're helping people  who are alcoholics or helping people who  are drug addicts but sure you get out  and deal with that you know but it's  also something much more sophisticated  like democracy well maybe i'm helping  laos maybe i'm helping myanmar because i  want to help them have a democracy but  you help these people and you figure out  the people you're helping they don't  want democracy at all i don't mean  everyone by the imagine the particular  people you're helping however many  hundred thousand there you can be  dealing with that certainly with china  the vast majority of people in china  will tell you straight to your face they  don't want democracy so what are you  helping them do if you're if you're  helping china the chinese they may even  be quite proud to tell you that they  don't they don't want democracy so a lot  of people don't want sobriety a lot of  people don't want democracy so  again you have you have good intentions  um but you can't have good intentions  for someone else and this is uh you know  so these these uh  these problems of motivation are dealt  with here so another so alia read the  book someone else just said uh she i  presume is 20 years old and not sure  what to do with her life and is also  tempted to do humanitarian work in a  different party so alia read the book  it's one dollar  as melissa was just saying before if you  were here that it can it can change your  whole life  um  but you know the question that puts  people again again so ali has volunteer  rangers he's 20 years old i would say to  someone who's 40 years old or 50 years  old also  the ultimate question is not the  outcomes you're going to achieve but  what kind of person you want to be  so if you do this for five years because  you can't commit  100 years you can't commit 50 years okay  who are you going to be after five years  of doing this  and sometimes with some kind of  humanitarian work the answer is not good  it's not going to make you a better  person you're not going to learn  anything you're not going to you're not  going to benefit you know it's really  just going to be a waste of your time  and potential when you could have when  you could have been reading a salast  when you could have been reading cicero  or something there could have been  something better you were doing with  those years and you know like really you  know there's some forms of humanitarian  work where you will not benefit in that  way  but you know if you can find  humanitarian work or if you can create  humanitarian workers that was what it  was talking about was creating your own  foundation getting your own donations  doing your own thing where you are going  to become a better person by helping  others and through the struggle to make  the world a better place then do it  totally and i'll say this as cynical as  i am about the humanitarian sector i  could digress into a i could digress  into a long critique of everything  that's wrong with the humanitarian  sector i'm much more cynical about  university  right so five years of humanitarian work  versus five years in a university  classroom as a student  it's so easy for me to think that you're  going to benefit much more  from five years of humanitarian work for  example in laos or cambodia and so on  you know um it's so easy i can think of  a million examples and it's so easy for  me to think you will learn nothing and  you'll become a worse person  especially for those years from age 20  days 25 being being in a university  classroom now you know  um  [Music]  there are people who do humanitarian  work and all they do is preach the bible  and take orphans away from their parents  and tell them how they're supposed to  worship jesus there are lots of terrible  examples of human terror and there were  muslims doing all these things too  spreading islam you know religious  charity work so on and so forth and you  know you might think there's no bad way  to help a drug addict or to help an  alcoholic yes there is you might think  there's no bad way to run an orphanage  yes there is there are a lot of horror  stories you might think there's no bad  way to run a farm an agricultural produ  project to overcome starvation  the horror stories are are there many  more than the the the positive examples  and mention so i wonder if i can find it  here quickly enough but i made the video  on my channel talking about somali mom  so there's no reason why you're right  now this is a cambodian name  but if you search my channel for  s-o-m-a-l-y  i'll see if i get the link here that's a  really instructive horror story about  the way  the charity sector works i mean it's  partly an anecdote but a particular  example  um but it's it's you know partly this is  only 11 minutes long it's a short but  highly impactful video  the way in which the sector is  profoundly corrupt and profoundly evil  there's the link if you look at the like  s-o-m-a-l-y if you just search for that  name within my channel  um  and the way in which humanitarian  organizations will really fraudulently  create the illusion of a problem  and then fraudulently create the  illusion that they're there's a solution  and that if you pay them money they are  the solution or they're offering the  solution and the whole the whole thing  is a fraud and people get hurt and  nobody gets helped that is very real and  that that happens even in agriculture it  definitely happens in education like  english language teaching education and  the people being defrauded can can be  the volunteers themselves can be the  workers can be the english teachers  themselves can be these people you know  who is defrauded it's not always the  donors who are being who are being  defrauded so on and so forth  um  [Music]  anyway uh sorry so one one question  leads to another theo smith writes in  and says quote he is 21 years old and  thinking about studying stoicism what  are your thoughts on this philosophy and  what made you interested in dialysis so  melissa i have a book on the shelf it  may be with my spanish books about  seneca do you think you can  oh  you're right that's why i don't have it  okay so i can't show you the book i have  a book that's on my phone  um  i guess i could fire up my  phone um hopefully my phone doesn't  start making it doesn't start making uh  knowledge doesn't start making noise so  look uh theo um  stoicism  regarded as a philosophy is complete  horseshit there's no need to read it or  study it if you're thinking of it in  this sense as a discrete philosophy as a  teaching as a book on the shelf however  the politics of stoicism  like the historical context what was  going on who these people were  politically what they were trying to  accomplish now they feel that is worth  reading that is worth understanding now  this may seem like a strange comparison  but  i got to be honest with you guys  if someone asked me about the lives of  painters like let's say renaissance  painters in europe  i don't think the paintings are really  worth looking at  i don't in many cases some of those guys  wrote autobiographies or wrote you know  manifestos for the arts you know what  they're doing as painters  you know  it's kind of similar like you know if  you're looking at this as a philosophy  in itself it's not that significant  however very often  um understanding the history  understanding the politics understanding  the struggle that artists was engaged in  for example a struggle against the  catholic church that this was a painter  who in his way from a position of  powerlessness was trying to challenge  the ignorance of the society he lived in  the power of the church  that can be tremendously meaningful even  though like the paintings they may just  be naked women like a lot of those it's  one sexy naked woman after another like  it's just as dumb as playboy really um  you know this is true of the renaissance  it's true of many different periods of  of art you know so i i'd make that that  kind of comparison so i do have a book  i'm reading now that is about seneca and  the life of seneca who's a um uh stoic  philosopher but reading about seneca is  different than reading seneca if you're  asking me what is the value of  uh stoic philosophy as such  my answer is  zero it's nil it's null and void it's so  it's of no uh  no value at all  um  just get you the actual title of the  book  i have i haven't finished it but i have  a positive  so the title of the book is the greatest  empire colon a life of a seneca  and one of the few female authors who's  been featured on the channel the author  is emily wilson  so  is that the first  female author we've covered on this  channel covered positively yes so far i  have a very positive impression of it  uh we'll see  you know  um  some of these questions are hilarious  they don't know why it's hilarious uh  ari asks quote if you could continue  your studies at any university in the  world what would your top three choices  be what a great question  not applicable not applicable not  available there are zero there are zero  positive options for me anywhere in the  world and this has now been researched i  don't know 43 this research for 20 years  we had 20 years of research on this and  sorry i've told this another before so  i'm going to tell it really briefly i  want so i've spoken to hundreds of  university professors hundreds and  hundreds it's not a low number of it  might be over a thousand but hundreds of  university professors have spoken to  certainly over the years there was one  university professor i spoke to he was  actually rejecting a peer-reviewed  article i'd submitted and it was  rejected before it went to peer review  and he wrote to me and said hey look i'm  sorry the delay took so long but no  we're not going to publish it  but he said in effect like look it's a  brilliant article it's a it's a good  article i forget how flattering he was  he said but we're not going to publish  it for this stupid reason was this  completely basically you said all we  publish are the articles of people who  are personal friends of ours friends we  don't real like this isn't really peer  reviewer it's not really based on that  and i remember i wrote back to him and  said well look i know how full of [ __ ]  you are because the article was about  cambodia you published this other  article about cambodia and i know the  guy who wrote it he doesn't know  anything about cambodia he's never been  to cambodia he's just a friend of yours  so you published his article about  cambodia you do publish articles about  cambodia but you publish articles by  completing the ramus when they're about  cambodia you won't publish articles by  someone who's actually devoted years  their life to this and has lived there  and studied the language and we're like  this is the reality of your of your  value you pretend this is pure review  it's not it's just nepotism and by the  way that wasn't the end of the  conversation so credit then we kept  dying  but he knew i was right i mean it's rare  or for someone but he was like yeah you  know you're right  they're not going to follow the article  you know i forget i think that article  eventually was published somewhere i did  i did get it  but anyway um  anyway he he continued talking to me and  the kind of the next thing he said was  like well you know  this university in london that he's at  um london england you know it's a really  bad university it's terrible in this way  in that way you shouldn't come here to  get a phd and and you know it's so much  money you couldn't possibly and i wrote  back i could get the email today but  this is this is from memory  i wrote back to my said  don't talk to me about money  don't say to me that it's about money  are you [ __ ]  kidding me no like we're talking about  like 10 years of my life here right like  let's not even pretend it's four years  i've been a huge amount of time already  put into this and still gonna be put  into this nothing compares to sinking 10  years of your life into a project like  the tuition fees here are immaterial and  i said yeah in case you haven't guessed  i wasn't born poor okay  if there were a legitimate educational  opportunity for me at your university or  any university anywhere in the world i  could ask my father to buy me a solid  gold pen so i could sit down and write  my phd thesis on a solid gold desk and  it wouldn't make any [ __ ] difference  in the world okay there is no amount of  money that can buy me an education not  at your university and not anywhere else  and a gold pen and a cold desk won't  help and the tuition went up like the  problem is the university is bad the  problem is you are bad you are a bad  professor your publication is bad you're  all like sorry but this is the context  of the conversation we're talking about  the profound way in which the whole  system is corrupt the problem is the  problem isn't cost the problem is you  have no education to offer there is no  positive opportunity there to be bought  at any price  you know  again read my books  if you want to hear more ranting about  how terrible university education is the  next book especially no more manifestos  there's a really harsh condemnation of  the university system is it as soon as  this but hilariously and again i think  this guy recognized that i was an  unusually brilliant student or person or  whatever he probably just appreciated  the quality of the writing and this in  this email christmas again he read one  article he read this one  so he knew something about what i was  capable of in terms of research and  writing and everything else  so i i don't know how impressed he was  with me but i take it he was impressed  because he was continuing this  conversation that was incredibly hostile  and inimical to him was condemning him  at his university but even though he had  started this he had started by  condemning his own university and saying  was terrible  as soon as they said this the next day  we said he said oh well if your family  has the money you should do it or if  your parents can afford it oh you should  sign up and look i'll talk to a  professor we can get you in  [Laughter]  completely overturning what he had said  himself before that it's a terrible  universal place you shouldn't study and  completely oversharing with that says oh  you got the money oh  we got a chalkboard we got an empty disk  if you got the money  like i could not have asked for a better  indictment more of an you know  unintentional parody of the reality of  what higher education is so you asked me  um  you know  what are my top three universities if  there was even one i'd already be there  you know i'd already be studying there i  don't have one opportunity anywhere in  the world and i've looked everywhere  asia europe america canada okay  admittedly i  i didn't really look at africa like  there were parts of the world i didn't  investigate but a huge brother well  including like poland including slovakia  including small towns within canada  including university of lethbridge like  i looked under every stone i would say i  don't know a single positive opportunity  for myself i don't know a single puzzle  of two females and guys in case you  think it's just buddhist philosophy  we're talking about or just anthropology  or just politics you know melissa and i  looked for a business school i was  willing to get an mba i was going to get  a master's in business i was wanting to  study in that sense economics you know  applied economics i was going to look at  so many different possibilities and so  many headaches and i you know  it never occurred to me that the type of  rot  the type of corruption that i'd  encountered in academia would be so  widespread that it would include you  know even even business school you know  so on and so forth you know yes iowa x  is shouting out arizona state i have  heard the legends that the women are  incredibly good looking at arizona state  university but i i don't know if i  believe it i don't know if it's actually  reasonable to think that women would be  better looking at one university than  another i i  perhaps perhaps merely arizona state  university has a culture that causes the  less attractive students to conceal  themselves and the more attractive  students to exhibit themselves that's  believable to me but i don't know if i  believe that arizona state university  actually has more attractive women than  any other university but maybe i'm wrong  there are factors i i can't imagine  involved here  all right just uh glancing over um  uh so look we have questions about  nihilism but guys there's a whole  playlist on nihilism we've had many long  profound discussions about nihilism and  again you can read both books i don't  know which one which ones i mean look  i'll be honest this is a short book i  mean you know it doesn't announce itself  as a philosophy of nihilism but it  really is giving you the philosophy of  what it means to be a distant  intellectual to be someone who is um  someone whose values profoundly  challenge the values of the society  they're born into whether that's because  you're a nihilist or not someone who  wants to change the world and then how  to live with that how to you know  uh how to move how to move forward from  there so yeah there's a lot of practical  analysis there but hey as i said neither  of my books repeat what's found on my  youtube channel no more manifestos is  not a recapitulation of uh  the videos on my youtube channel already  here and noor is future of an illusion  they're they're both genuinely original  books the original material that way but  there's a long playlist of videos um  talking about uh nihilism oliver is in  the crowd oliver can you name you don't  have to give the link can you name a  particular video i did on nihilism that  you recommend especially  it's from memory i know  but so many  yeah right now some of them are like  artistic statements about nihilism  rather than  oh right nihilism colon the only  philosophy you can really live by for an  introduction  you know that's a pretty good one i have  another one called the definition of  nihilism common political philosophy  what about santa claus melissa says  is it in the title  okay yeah  um i you know i talked about it with  oliver not too long ago i do think that  my early videos about nihilism are kind  of too friendly they're they're making  it a little bit too easy on you and you  could complain my more recent ones are  too abrasive that's possible too right  it's possible i'm now going too hard at  the paint on that but anyway uh you know  um  but it is true i don't think my my very  first videos about nihilism are the best  ones i think oh nihilism colon living as  if santa claus isn't watching  wow cheese deep cuts that's more than  that's closer to five years ago  so yeah yeah yeah yeah  yeah  yep  okay guys so in wrapping up this video  i'm just going to say uh we opened with  a discussion of niala  and not a discussion  we open the discussion of nostalgia and  what i've now termed you know toxic  nostalgia  and i do think that um  part of the problem with nostalgia in  perpetuating our own childishness or  perpetuating our own teenagers you know  our own immaturity with reference to  more of a teenage phase of intellectual  development is just the lack of  awareness  that there's something better on the  horizon there's something better to  struggle for there's something better to  work towards and what is that something  better i'm talking about it's not having  more money it's not having a fancier car  it's not a more expensive pair of shoes  it's not sleeping with more beautiful  women it's not i'm not  that's not what i mean by a better life  guys it's not living in a better  apartment you know that there is  actually a better person you can be  there's a better person you can become  over the horizon you can't see that  version yet you can't imagine that  person yet you you genuinely cannot  imagine the better person you can become  and you will become if only you try and  if only you're willing to fail you know  again and again and again and so you  know the price of nostalgia  the price of justifying the things you  enjoyed when you were mature the price  of you know  the vindication  of the stupidity of your youth with the  stupidity of your adulthood  is that you're not  looking  you know you're not looking to that  further horizon you're not thinking  about what's possible and then  discovering possibilities that for you  heretofore had been  inconceivable unthought of by things you  you  things you didn't think were possible or  impossible things you you never  you never dreamt of you never you'd  never conceived of you know  um  this is  you know shutting off  the yearning  and restlessness  that is absolutely  part of the experience of youth  that ironically enough  nostalgic middle-aged people  are trying to recapture they're trying  to recapture that spirit that feeling  that sense  that they could have been a policeman  they could have been a farmer that could  have been anyone they could become  somebody different they could do they  could do something daring they could  challenge themselves to do something  they now find terrifying and become a  different person as a result you know we  use this term edgy today mostly in a in  a sarcastic way in a caustic way you  know an edgy teenager or somebody doing  or saying something edgy well yeah when  you're young enough and ignorant enough  everything is edgy every trivial thing  is edgy always remember this this is a  nothing moment but it was so telling to  me so we we used to spend time in the  south of france  because my daughter was connected to the  southern france  my ex-wife's family is connected to  south of france and there were a lot of  very rich people in the southern france  there are poor people too but there are  millionaires around and i remember was  just walking past um it's in a very rich  neighborhood it was a very expensive  cafe and there were two girls i know 19  year old girls there are two female  friends  and  it was just so telling you could  absolutely read it on their face and you  could also tell from their clothing and  so on these were incredibly wealthy  girls who had been raised in such a  wealthy family and by the way there was  a yacht  harbor right there like probably their  parents were on the yacht and they were  just so excited  to sit down in a cafe and talk with each  other without parental supervision  without you know some kind of caretaker  you know or security guard so they're  like oh wow you know like oh we get to  order for ourselves you know what i mean  and i get that i mean especially with  wealthy people a lot of them have been  you know put in this ultra conformist  position where other people are taking  care of them you know just the the level  of risk involved in walking alone to a  cafe to not have someone drive you there  or not have someone order for you or  something you know i get that when  you're young enough and you're ignorant  enough and you're sheltered enough right  even that has a kind of thrill has a  kind of  excitement to it of pushing into the  unknown right  what nostalgia is ultimately is this  attempt to keep yourself fettered to the  ignorance of youth so that you can have  the enjoyments of youth and you can't  you know  you can't cheating on your wife is never  going to make you happy cheating on your  boyfriend cheating on your husband it's  not you know and i was gonna sound  ridiculous but you can talk you can talk  to people about this  people who talk about the excitement of  buying their first car it's very alien  to me even if it was the worst car in  the world it was your first car you were  so excited you were so proud and it  probably was scary too your first time  driving on the highway your first time  driving to a new place you never you  didn't know where you were going and  driving into the unknown you know well  guess what you could never have that  again either you know it's it's all kind  it's all based on ignorance and fear and  childishness and stupidity right you  know you can't have that which you have  to be looking at what you have to be  aspiring towards you have to be  motivated by is something over that  horizon is a better person you can be is  you know again  look back at those experiences as  stepping stones if you can maybe they  were tragedies and heartbreaking like  for real i get that hopefully to some  extent they were stepping stones  preparing you now to have different  aspirations different ambitions you know  ambitions that cannot possibly revolve  around video games  comic books cartoons pornography  from my perspective i can't even be  downhill skiing i'm sorry maybe downhill  skiing was very thrilling for you when  you were 14 years old maybe you know  like about your first time being on skis  like your first time driving a car it  can't be about fancy cars you know i  mean the meaningful life i'm sorry but  it it  definitionally leads you away from all  of these meaningless things and all  these challenge things and what it's  leading you towards or what it is you're  going to chase over that horizon  definitionally also that's something you  can't imagine  yet  what will make you happy what will be  meaningful and rewarding for you as an  adult it's different from what will be  fascinating alluring  uh to you as a child in many ways you  know like i've already given examples  here playing sonic the hedgehog too as a  boy or just seeing a beautiful woman or  what have you you know the way that  these things can  can thrill you okay so i've reflected on  many different aspects of how  you know happiness as an adult a  meaningful life as an adult is different  but i'm going to add just one more at  the end of this video okay  one of the differences about being an  adult  is  responsibility  as opposed to irresponsibility one of  the differences as an adult is caring  about  consequences  one of the differences as an adult is  thinking long term  thinking about where you're going to be  what you're going to be doing and who  you're going to be  just  five  years from now  and as soon as you start  thinking that way  the limited number of hours you have  when you're really alert because we're  all awake for the sake okay let's say  we're awake for the same number of hours  a day we're alive for the same number of  hours a day you may sleep 12 hours you  may sleep eight hours the number of  hours you have per day in which you can  really be productive and if you have a  two-week vacation from work right the  number of hours you can be productive  during those two weeks that's that's  limited too okay as soon as you are  thinking in this more adult way of  taking on responsibilities of having  ambitions of being aware that there's  this other person you're gonna be just  five years from now and you're  fashioning them you're forming them with  the decisions you make today it becomes  inconceivable to you and it becomes  repugnant to you to go on living the way  you did when you were a teenager it  becomes inconceivable to you becomes  repugnant to you to  chain yourself to childish pleasures to  wrap yourself in a kind of voluntary  ignorance so you can go on  enjoying childish pleasures and if you  still actually own the comic books for  either you still actually own the video  games you're only going to feel a sense  of revulsion and remorse towards them  and looking at them and saying this is  what my life used to consist of this was  my happiness this was my joy this was  what consumed me and yes yes y'all i  think there are a lot of men  i don't think it is talked about on  youtube i think men don't talk about  unju i think there were a lot of men who  got to look back at the women they were  sleeping with  whether it was a monogamous girlfriend  or whether they were cheating on one  girlfriend to gina but let's say you  know the women they had affairs with the  women they pursued and the way in which  those affairs utterly consumed them and  then who they were and what they were  left with afterwards you know there are  going to be men who really they really  need to regret that they really need to  look back on the meaninglessness of that  and start thinking about new directions  and new meaning in their lives i think  for middle-aged women it's just even  more taboo middle-aged woman who cheats  on her husband sleeping with a younger  man and then she's left with these same  kind of regrets or reflections even if  she hates her husband by the way doesn't  mean her husband's a good guy doesn't  mean i like her husband i'm just saying  you know  no matter how horrible her husband is  you know you live you live your life in  the pursuit of these short-term  self-centered selfish pleasures and now  you're left with these these unanswered  questions right certainly the erotic  impulse that as i've described  at length is also involved in this kind  of toxic nostalgia it leads to the same  regrets and the same demand for new  horizons new mandate new mission new  ambition and there's this new person  there's this different person there's  this other person that you are going to  be  um  [Music]  i think it's hard  to visualize what we mean  by responsibility  when you're talking about the life of an  artist talking about a creative artist  talking about a youtuber talking about a  writer  you know  take the time to think about it  it'll get less  vague  right i write books okay how many more  books i'm going to write i have some  other books i'd like to write in my mind  right now you know i'd like to publish  children's story books too not just  books for adults  um i make youtube videos you may have  noticed i'm not sure what creative arts  i'm going to go into it seems like it's  not going to be painting or drawing for  now i've really considered that in the  past there's creative work i i want to  do  you know  what is the role of responsibility  in being a creative artist and being a  creative person it might be easy to talk  about responsibility when we're talking  about humanitarian work people are  starving you want to take responsibility  and give them food  constant responsibility is very clear  all right it takes a little bit more  philosophizing to think about what it  means to have a sense of responsibility  as a painter  as a poet as a writer as a youtuber  right  but it's very real and i think it's more  real and it's more important  in the way it changes and informs your  life here and now like even if you're a  dentist like you you don't have any  creative art in your life understanding  what responsibility means for the life  of an artist or the life of a youtuber  life of a writer has a lot to do  with the life of an adult any adult  and frankly what the meaning of life for  you means  on a day-to-day basis  talked to so many different people on  youtube over the years who have lived in  thailand  six months one year or two years  sometimes people live there for five  years  and they knew  nothing about the politics and history  of thailand there was a revolution there  was a coup d'etat they wrote a new  constitution during the years they went  out during exactly the time that they  were living there every day and i know  they were there like they were uploading  to youtube or whatever there's proof you  were in the country when these momentous  political events happened and i know  i've i've lived in thailand enough to  know not only was that stuff on the tv  news and the radio and the newspaper  they were literally loudspeakers in  thailand  and listen i don't remember that we were  there yeah so at different times there's  different yeah but there can be  literally loudspeakers blaring letting  you know what's going on what yeah just  say i found that interesting because i  had been in china which is yeah that's  right  it's so much more subtle in china yeah  in america people say like this this is  this horrible dictatorship um but like  actually being in thailand and hearing  these government announcements on the  loudspeaker right right right right  right right right  i wasn't expecting that yeah yeah yeah  yeah  um  okay good good suggestion from oliver  i'm just gonna give the the link to that  i asked oliver what he'd recommend for a  uh  for a for a major video on on nihilism  oh that's an old one okay well if you  say so uh nihilism colon religious  ideology versus political ideology give  the give the link for that for what's  worth  um that's cool it's all over it's back  um  no let's go if i watched all these  videos getting help maybe i'd agree with  them maybe i maybe i wouldn't yeah  that's true anyway it's funny political  propaganda in china is much more subtle  but yeah in thailand it's not that's  like how did you disregard these  political conditions how do you  disregard these momentous changes in  this juvenile that were happening while  you were there  and you know  to some extent if you're a youtuber you  are a creative artist even if your art  is the monologue i hope you've been  enjoying this three-hour work of art  i've been creating here for you guys you  know of course it matters  of course it matters of course having a  sense  of responsibility if you are a painter  living in thailand while the revolution  is going on outside of your window  what does being a responsible person  mean i'm telling you this like for real  the revolution never stops guys  it's happening all the time  no matter where you are if you'll just  let yourself see it i knew a guy very  interesting guy  he had lived and worked in myanmar  now i was considering living and working  in myanmar i never did you know i lived  in cambodia laos thailand but you know  myanmar didn't so i was asking him  questions and about the political  context he lived in itself and he told  me this story it was before he started  work  i think you have to understand the  geometry of this just just slightly so  um a lot of shops are like this this was  a coffee shop that had a staircase  leading up from the sidewalk just about  half a floor so you know you're not on  the second floor but you're above the  sidewalk so there's the road there's the  sidewalk and you have a little staircase  going up to a little kind of patio where  there are some tables and he was sitting  there drinking coffee from a cup and  saucer  and thinking about  what he was doing at work that day  and  a tank  rolled down the street in front of him a  full military tank you know it's a  combat  tank it's not a crowd control tank it's  not a police tank it's a it's a combat  tank and he just stopped i think without  being aware of it he stopped  drinking his coffee like he has the  coffee up to his mouth like this or  something  and the tank turns  and points the barrel of the gun  straight at him  you know  and again because his table is a little  bit raised off the the ground right i  think you can imagine the height of the  elevation of a tank and if the barrel  this is a you know  this is a bullet that would completely  destroy the building he's sitting in  front of it wouldn't just  kill him  and um you know he said obviously he  couldn't see himself but he said you  know the expression on his face was one  of absolute terror like i think he was  just transfixed with terror he didn't  describe further  what the expression his face was but he  remained silent he didn't say anything  or screaming he didn't get up and run  away as as he told the story to me he  didn't jump on the ground or i mean  another way to respond is to  get out of the way of the bullet or  something  and then the um  the top of the tank  opens up  and it's this burmese teenager inside  who's laughing his ass off  and he was he found it so hilarious the  expression on this guy's face and the  bernie sanders don't worry about i was  just joking like speaking in burmese  obviously you know the guy is left but  he's like he's laughing so hard like his  sides are like can barely talk or like  he's really  you know totally a busting on laughing  damn  momentous  political events  are unfolding in front of you  sometimes this is made as obvious as  being held at gunpoint  by a combat tank when you are minding  your own business drinking a cup of  coffee  normally it is not  i had one friend one fan of the channel  who was in minneapolis  during the riots there so there's now  about two years ago right the death of  george floyd the riots that ensued okay  i was writing to her saying well look  you know okay let me put it this way i  was interested in buying an airplane  ticket and going and staying in a hotel  to be there and witness  history as it unfolded now i can reflect  now to what extent i do or don't regret  that i i didn't have that experience  obviously a once in a lifetime you know  experience okay yeah  events like that that's more like a tank  rolling down the road you know what i  mean okay  something is happening here all right  but you know beneath the veneer of the  conformist monotony that dominates our  adult lives all right the underlying  problems and the the the voice that's  screaming out for a solution the need  for innovation it's there  all the time  all right if you're an artist  of any kind if you're an intellectual of  any kind whether you write whether you  make youtube videos okay it means that  your art is reflecting that silent  scream  it means that you see the revolution  that is happening or you see the  revolution that needs to happen  all the time  all right  before the tanks roll on the street or  even if the tanks never all rolled down  the street that you are seeing and you  are responding to the tensions the  contradictions the evil in your society  that may be just as easily ignored as  the slaughterhouses that are slitting  the throats of cows and pigs everywhere  that may be just as easily ignored as  the hospitals that are performing  circumcisions  making disabled people out of infants  boys and girls that are having 60 of the  nerve endings and their penises and  vaginas cut off forever due to this  barbaric religion we're saddled with all  three of them are barbaric by the way  christianity judaism islam i'm not  making any excuses for any of them  they're all carrying out circumcisions  invisibly right now how many  circumcisions happened in your country  today and tomorrow  okay there is a silent scream here that  something has to change that somebody  has to jilt us out of the darkness of  the dark ages and light a lamp and lead  the way ahead the horror that is 21st  century democracy this utterly phony  utterly corrupt system of democracy  utterly phony utterly corrupt court and  justice system we have oh isn't it easy  to point the finger at myanmar  oh you know in myanmar they don't have  real democracy isn't it easy to point  the finger at communist china or at  cambodia today cambodia is not communist  but it's some kind of crazy dictatorship  you know post-communist just barely  post-communist you know horrible  dictatorship okay you know isn't it easy  to point the finger at iran  take a look at the society you're living  in right now  how democratic is it really how  different are the institutions in your  life compared to communist china if you  live in china you'll be shocked at how  similar life is there and it's similar  they have no democracy at all we have  practically none  okay being in a university in china is  very much the same as being in the  university of the united states of  america why  is it that we have a communist  university system or that they have a  capitalist one neither neither of us  have any [ __ ] new ideas since we came  out of the dark ages right there's a  crucial terrible need yes sure to change  the police you know uh this is the  specific issue with sure to perform the  police to reform parliament to reform  congress to reform the senate to reform  elections to reform election funding to  reform the media sure i was gonna say to  reform the media to reform social media  freedom of speech this is newly talked  about with twitter melissa mentioned the  supreme court yeah from my perspective  the whole legal system including  something like the supreme court the  constitution law how that functions  there are these you know terrible needs  that you have to be  sensitive to that you have to feel  responsible for in your life as an  intellectual in your in your life as an  artist right and that kind of  responsibility right it's not as easy to  just  identify it's not as easy to mentate to  think through clearly as the kind of  responsibility you have you say oh look  there is an earthquake people are  starving let's get some money and hand  out food you know to starving people i'm  making this video  you know  i really do feel  that we live in a world that's starving  for democracy  what's what's happening in myanmar okay  it [ __ ] me up all right  we live in a world  that is starving for democracy  and it's not just myanmar  it's not just hong kong  and we live in a world  of mediocre middle-aged conformists  who are not willing to stand up and  fight a revolution  we're not willing to lift a finger we're  not even willing to walk down the street  to city hall  for the sake of democracy  in their own homeland okay  and  in the same way that being vegan  involves a kind of commitment we say  look  i accept that not everybody has what it  takes  not everybody can be vegan  but in a sense i'm going to be vegan for  you i am going to stand up and do the  right thing in place of all the people  who should but can't and won't even if  that's just because they're too stupid  or too immoral or whatever it is okay  okay okay some people can't be vegan but  i can all right the role of a dissident  intellectual and the role of a creative  artist involves you  stepping up you taking on that  responsibility and that burden  because maybe other people  can't  but if you can  you  must  that's  your responsibility  and i'd like to think if you watch my  youtube videos and you read my books  once you see it  it's something you can't unsee  and then you also will feel this  terrible sense of responsibility i do  to make the world a better place  i remember a black politician  saying  a black american politician saying that  he always felt a connection to the  jewish people in america and he told  this whole long story about when he was  a teenager  um a particular elderly jewish  shopkeeper who helped him and several  particular jewish people who really  helped him in america when america was  very segregated and most white people  were very mean to him and you knew these  particular jewish people and jewish  business people who really really helped  him really encouraged him to get a  university education and things too that  he had these positive connections to  jewish people and that he carried that  the rest of his life as as an  african-american and went on to do  politics you know guys  nobody from myanmar has ever done  anything nice for me  not even one conversation all right  nobody from hong kong seriously i used  to live in hong kong i have nothing good  to say about the people of myanmar  people hong kong i have nothing good to  say about the people of cambodia either  you know like i don't feel any kind of  connection you know or or debt of  gratitude there i don't  and i know for most of you you don't  either maybe a few of you do maybe a few  of you  you had a  burmese landlord or you had a cambodian  landlord it was really it's possible  some of you do feel some connection  because you've known some cambodian  people right  but i mean you know my point is  this obligation you have it isn't just  to your own homeland it isn't just to  people you like  it's the same obligation to the people  you despise and to the people  who despise you back this really is a  question of the future of the planet it  really is a question of the future of  the world  and  that's the burden i live with  and the fundamental question i'm asking  on this channel  again again  is  what about you</div>
