    <h1>Vegan "Purity": Collaborating with Hunters to Save the Hunted, etc.</h1>

    <hr>
    <p>A video addressed to the ways in which the "personal purity" paradigm can shape our engagement with political issues in veganism… although "political pragmatism" does not offer us any sort of easy alternative.<br><br><br><br>Usual disclaimer: IF I LOOK EXHAUSTED, IT'S BECAUSE I AM EXHAUSTED.  ;-)</p>

    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">politics is one of <br />abstract philosophical questions in a way
on a large scale in terms of the future of
you but it also matters in our personal lives
conversations we have everyday conflicts we
with have to figure out a way out of of course
the heading of political philosophy where
example kick off this video you may or may
face to face with a meat-eater or over the
where the meat-eater is saying to you with
like where the meteor says to you how can
all you're talking about is food all right
implicit contrast here between really important
the United States bombing Iraq the progress
and this category of merely personal preferences
purity so from the meteors perspective in
this scenario from the meteors perspective
kosher diet because they're both ultimately
food and on a deeper level it's just talking
to you look I have some tolerance for hearing
diet or a Buddhist diet but bottom line to
of real philosophy real politics real social
whether it's the bombing of Mosul what what
unions protesting for higher wages raising
set of examples they happen to care about
this channel sympathy is especially important
for vegans to sympathize the other side and
they perceive us as people that way and why
trying to engage with and address in that
meat eaters perceive our movement that way
been actively packaging and promoting veganism
lose weight feel great have fewer heart attacks
kind of thing and then a step beyond that
in pseudo spiritual terms where it does indeed
to resemble a Hindu diet a purity based mentality
impacting more vegans although some vegans
of personal purity purification detoxing etc
who think about the significance and importance
we're in an unexamined way the issue of identity
is about purity here's an example that right
who go around arguing primarily to other vegans
like this is this isn't outreach this isn't
internal issue within because vegans who argue
that you're not really vegan if you eat blueberries
of course blueberries a vegan what's the argument
United States rely so heavily on honeybees
almonds in the production of blueberries should
production of honey and honey from honeybees
look at the production of cow milk as being
that produces leather and veal and of course
with several different stages of production
they may be very sincere and telling you that
almond milk they may not be doing this in
this in a spiritual sense at all they may
know they may use the language of ecology
for the you know indirect ecological consequences
this in a completely down-to-earth way but
actually is a problem of thinking of veganism
is my conceptual way of explaining people
on a diagram the one person as a consumer
and then you're thinking of a circle drawn
around the point the diagram of how much ecological
to be more and more pure to more and more
or ethical negative negative ethical impacts
or not it's expressed in terms of purity the
house paint a lot of paint and glue products
these things come to the fore because the
to this title that defines personal purity
you can to shrink down the ecological and
choices of your diet their choices.
they don't believe in buying furniture or
out of recycled garbage repurposed materials
and this harms the environment and so on with
personal purity
just the other day I think just yesterday
a lot of issues my vegans another youtuber
organizer and my vegan I have a lot in common
her on specific issues and I make those videos
points of disagreement but you gotta realize
about two weeks ago she and I did a Skype
with Internet that lasted fully two hours
started at midnight and I hung up at 2 a.m.
that night.
of issues we agree about and I could make
those interesting just really summarizing
to us where you know we were both really a
we're actually gonna organize vegan movements
practical questions about what are we doing
and some of the more more theoretical and
know I do agree with mod vegan on a huge range
I got an email from Maude and she was saying
pro purity camp this purity based approach
a pragmatist a camp in which she would include
we've got to get back to doing a book review
its kind of part one but we me and my girlfriend
so those are interesting kind of dissident
Tobias later on
to her saying well you know it's been a long
quite a few videos and a couple of podcasts
about this at length and I listed off all
camp if anything I'm kind of an aunty purity
here look what is the problem in practice
an association like Ducks Unlimited that hunts
group that openly engages in fur trapping
a charity and do a conservation based project
saving a certain plot of land saving a certain
let's say a certain watershed are you willing
eat meat and that may be actively engage in
is in principle yes in practice maybe.
I could collaborate with hunters I'm actually
the definition of veganism very seriously,
think it’s about purity, but I say well
it's not flexible either you're vegan or you're
not here's the collaboration here's the common
build on it right.
I mean 98% of the potential support you can
are of course with meat eaters and quite possibly
or Laos or Canada I mean most of the crucial
officials our guard and bureaucrats would
monkey here in yunnan right on the border
to its last couple of trees of habitat that's
the you know the camera panned over the last
existing in the wild but other than that they
know ultimately funded by donations by people
this species of monkey from the the brink
cute a very endearing very harmless looking
heart-rending to see them in zoos or to see
“They’re in the forest, in [Chinese]
sell them”
“[There is a] monkey market”
do the fundraising, we all know it's easier
ugly animals, it's easier to do fundraising
the same way humans do, that breastfeed their
the struggle of this family of monkeys to
it's easier to do fundraising for that then
not so cute, but nevertheless with a project
we only work with other vegans, how can you
sit down and have lunch with and hammer out
officials, are current members of the Communist
members the government though that's absolutely
and then beyond that any other ecological
species conservation habitat conservation
quite likely they're gonna be involved in
you find morally objectionable.
is easy for you guys to imagine in a place
cooperation with a group that engages in hunting
as simple as a fundraising event at which
want to sell barbecued pork right let's look
we can't do this joint fundraiser you guys
have to openly say we're against it you know
as simple as a barbecue pork fundraiser which
the Cancer Foundation to see the counselor
barbecues to raise money for cancer research
try to cure answer it's ridiculous.
to that kind of cooperation but in practice
simple as they may be that may make cooperation
counter to the purity mentality because the
best vegan I can be which is understandable
pursuit of a personal identity a personal
as a vegan and my view of veganism is about
other people reaching out to other groups
to have the maximum impact on real world outcomes
a particular forest it may be getting a particular
new law you know it may be a lawsuit against
a lawsuit that's gonna draw attention to these
issues we hail look if we get our money together
can prove that this slaughterhouse is poisoning
take it to court take it to the press we can
to talk about the ecological responsibility
broadly the meat industry great that's what
maximum social change to ultimately make the
of society a better place.
maybe it is just help one species of dolphin
of land and maybe doing that involves a lot
that run counter to my own moral code my own
my hands dirty I want to roll up my sleeves
or personal perfection to impede my ability
far beyond me and do not just involve my ever
impacts in the world whether that be almonds
issue and the indirect honey depression issue
too long if you guys want to hear about that
a separate video talk about that because during
we actually did talk about that at some length
here is between the purity mentality and the
the pursuit of personal purity I'm vegan in</div>
