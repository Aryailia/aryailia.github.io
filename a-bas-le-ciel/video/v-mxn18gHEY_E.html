Here's her (ex-vegan) youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOu3SAozsyQyKE2wDAIJtdQ/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOu3SAozsyQyKE2wDAIJtdQ/videos</a><br><br>Shout out to Simon Rex, formerly known as Dirt Nasty.  He actually had a few messages back and forth with me on Tumblr, before I started this youtube channel, and back when he was still putting out rap albums.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dirttothenasty/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0">https://www.youtube.com/user/dirttothenasty/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0</a></p>
