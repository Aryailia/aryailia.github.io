    <h1>Buddhist Philosophy, Known or Unknown?</h1>
    <p>20 February 2014 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzOcSpxKVoA">[link youtube]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Is Buddhist philosophy something we can know (the same way that we know the philosophy of Plato, Aristotle, etc.) or is there some kind of special exception to the rules involved?  (Organized religions always seem to make themselves an exception to the rules, hm?)<br><br><br><br>Circa six minutes into the tape, "...[in modern Buddhism,] anyone who reads the text is a threat to the authority of the monk in charge.  It's a lot more convenient to organize your religion around silence [and] subservience to authority [than to allow] asking questions [and] debating the philosophy."<br><br><br><br>Want to know more about the textual basis of Buddhist Philosophy, and what's known (vs. unknown) today?  Here's an article that's half as long as it looks, presented in both Chinese and English: <a href="http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.tw/2014/03/canon-and-reason-complete-chinese.html">http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.tw/2014/03/canon-and-reason-complete-chinese.html</a></p>
