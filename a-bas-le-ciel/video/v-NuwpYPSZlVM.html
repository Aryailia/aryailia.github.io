    <h1>Ferris Wheel & Vegan Fishing Trip (With My Daughter)</h1>
    <p>14 February 2018 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuwpYPSZlVM">[link youtube]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>More "quality time with the family Mazard": for absolutely no reasonable reason, my ex-wife forced us to travel by train to collect (and drop off) my daughter from Dijon, France.  This cost me over 1000 Euros, and, also, took up two days of my seven day visit (we spent four days, in total, just riding the train, i.e., ALL DAY, back and forth, although only two of the four trips were with my daughter).  My ex-wife has never given me any reason as to why she did this to us (we booked long in advance, and included her in the decision-making as to where we'd book a home for the holiday, etc.).  But yes, we had to pack quite a lot of vegan food, and try to prepare fun and games for a very long train ride with a 4 year old: and, despite everything, it was indeed fun.  On the way back I prepared for her a chocolate-covered banana (to eat on the train) and the remains of this banana were, hilariously, received with horror by my ex-wife, who then wrote me an email accusing me of feeding my daughter nothing but chocolate bananas.  This was, indeed, hilarious, but for all I know, my daughter boasted that she ate chocolate-covered bananas every day (whereas, in fact, it was something she had twice during a 7-day trip).</p>

    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">so I was just asking my daughter if she<br />has ever been on a ferris wheel before
this fabulous view of the city not
descending knee nice and only after we
got all on the ferris wheel that I
realized I myself have in fact never
once been on a ferris wheel in my life
my daughter has though my daughter has
been on one in Dijon France before and
now here we are going round a rail yeah
I'm so glad you can enjoy level 4 a 4
year old it's a little bit scary for not
too scary you can see the ocean in the
distance of one side and down the other
and she did a little scared she can just
hug up with us the ferris wheel and
enter nice
red sky at morning red sky at night this
game is more fun to play on the train
because the whale is constantly rocking
are you gonna color in the mask pink no
you think it's finished okay
I thought you could add feathers and us
Daigo so your disguised as yourself no
this time you didn't make a nose the
first math Schmidt you remember we saw
and we saw different types of fish
yesterday we saw octopuses we saw
clownfish the clownfish were the most
colorful maybe so you could you could
make a picture of a fish that looks like
one of the fish we saw yesterday at the
Museum if you want to also instead of
catching a fish you could draw boot
sometimes people go fishing and they
don't catch a fish they just catch a
boot Melissa I was not talking about
Melissa used to go fishing before she
became vegan once these two go
used to go this is what Joseph your dad
you know but it's true you can catch a
boot when when you go fishing but also
now that we're vegan if you wanted to
you could you could draw some tofu you
could draw you could draw some vegan and
we have we have vegan fish tips in this
kind of how big is the fish more than
the worm so you think when you catch
this fish he's just gonna nibble a
little bit on the worm he's not gonna
eat the whole worm yes I think you
either need to have a fish that is
bigger than the worm or a worm that is
smaller than the fish but that's okay
tiny little fish for your imaginary
fishing world</div>
