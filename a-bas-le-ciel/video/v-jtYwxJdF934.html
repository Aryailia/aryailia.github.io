    <p>Yeah, he decided he cares so much about freedom of speech that he's going to deprive me of mine, when I've been much more mild in my criticism of him than he's been in his criticism (and "satire") directed toward so many others.  Hey, it's real easy to practice what you preach when you're a hypocrite.  Oh yeah, right: you think Vegan Gains wasn't making "criminal allegations" when he claimed specific athletes were taking illegal steroids?  Did he make criminal allegations when he made R——— allegations against Durianrider?  If you consider my critique of Vegan Gains to be "slander", how do you evaluate his library of past videos?</p>
