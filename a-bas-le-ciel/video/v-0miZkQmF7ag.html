    <h1>The Solar System vs. the Bible vs. Skepticism</h1>
    <p>06 July 2014 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0miZkQmF7ag">[link youtube]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>It's a clear case of the Solar System vs. the Bible... and it isn't hard to guess which side is going to win (in terms of making sense of the world outside your window), but, in this case, the Bible has something important to teach us about the history of the English language, at least.<br><br><br><br>When atheists get into debating these issues with Christians (as both Jaclyn Glenn and The Amazing Atheist have recently done) they seem to be willing to allow their opponents to misrepresent Biblical cosmology as compatible with the modern solar system (or as being identical to modern physics, aside from the added presence of a divinity at the top) --and nothing could be further from the truth.  In most cases, the vagueness of Bible translations allows both sides to remain unaware of what it is that they're really debating, when they contrast ancient and modern preconceptions about the world.</p>
