    <p>Paradise for some, purgatory for others?  Conversation with an anonymous, mystery guest (who is no longer on youtube / vegan social media generally).  This was recorded in June of 2016.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">hey guys I'm sitting here with James a<br />guy who I've known on the internet for
some time and now for the first time we
met in person here in Thailand we
actually used to have conversations by
Skype I thought of him originally as a
vegan on reddit he started out really
making a lot of comments on veganism on
reddit he branched into YouTube there
were a couple of his videos in the past
that I've showed it out on this channel
and you may know him recently because
like like myself he's been at the center
of a storm of controversy and some
people have denounced him as a a cancer
on the on the feast today which you know
lets you let you know you're doing
something right um but yeah I think
there's actually some really thoughtful
and worthwhile content on his channel
and you like myself and like the other
channels I'm a fan of like you know
vegan cheetah I'm a fan of a lot of
people I may not have that much in
common with but where I feel they're
really being honest being really real
so this conversation we're gonna talk
about a you know an honest and
down-to-earth subject which is kind of
the the contrast between the reality of
Chiang Mai Chiang Mai is a city in
northern Thailand the reality of this
place and the mythology that surrounds
it a brief professor I'm gonna basically
ask Jake is is its experience but for me
during the last couple of years I
couldn't believe how romanticize Chiang
Mai was in the imagination of many of my
fellow vegans and I was thinking well
maybe it's gotten a little bit better
since I was there maybe it's because you
know you have a min do city in a fuse I
knew this place well you know ten years
ago already and I got here and I feel
like everything's just got worse
I view like the city's falling apart in
in so many obvious ways now I'll start
with a provocative topic you know we we
vegans Jake we like to pretend that we'd
never hurt a fly
we'd like to pretend that we'd never
kill a rat then if a rat came into our
own homes
we'd make it a bed and serve at dinner
and and treat it as equally as welcome
as our own friends and family but on the
streets of chiang mai you see quite a
few rats don't you
okay so I've quite a funny story about
that so yesterday I was walking home
with my partner in 18 after the karaoke
night that I met up with ISIL and a
bunch of other vegans and we were
walking home and we were talking about
the rats because my partner Nadine
really does not like rats you should
love alright okay I don't like spiders
I'm also equally as guilty so yeah we
were walking past and I talked about
rats coming out of the water because the
night before we had actually seen a rat
and Nadine Nadine makanda actually said
their water adds like they do so no
kidding five seconds later after I
mentioned rats three rats and like pop
out from like the sewers like through
these little holes and like as you walk
down the I guess the partial sidewalk
that's actually there that's what the
holes are for yeah yeah they make
special holes in the sidewalk that are
big enough for rats and cockroaches to
breathe them low and come back up it's
basically like a rat habitat faucet
project you know it's perfect yes yeah
you go on no I like I said increasing
the biodiversity of this beautiful city
the holes in the something I'll actually
comment on later but yeah that's I was
saying no kidding like five seconds
later we walk past in these three rats
pop out and Nadine just like jumps and
sushi she's actually sitting in the back
now listening to this and he's like
curling up in the corner just thinking
about this and here's me thinking like
okay I understand like because I feel
the same way about sliders as she does
about rats yeah and once again I kid you
not five seconds later I look down and
there is a spider like the size and I
did we both just like jump and scream
and this was not like I would say like
close to one o'clock in the morning this
seems when it's like really bad like the
night life comes out to play yeah and
then that was just like and then of
course like the cockroaches that are
just like always walking around and it
was like I I have seen I have seen a
cockroach eating the blood of a dead rat
you know rat yeah I mean you know I this
year there I noticed there are seem to
be very few mosquitoes in the city I
don't know if that's the season or if
it's actual deforestation a collage was
like ten years ago I think there were
more mosquitoes but
the cockroach game is still is still
pretty solid here walking down the
street there were three women women who
had straight jobs not students alone he
tried to flirt with me you know in anti
try to speak to me in Thai and I was
really exhausted from the heat and I
just didn't want to deal with it I just
was walking and you know no normally to
be honest to be a chance to practice the
language to speak some Thai with
somebody wants to speak to you and as I
was kind of just shuffling past them
this enormous cockroach you know went
towards their feet and because they were
looking at me they hadn't think they
suddenly looked down the sidewalk and
screamed all three of them screamed at
this cockroach yeah I don't know if it
quite touched them but it was right
right at their feet yeah Oh Emmy how you
grow up here you live here you work here
and you're still afraid of cockroaches
and that's human nature's is a funny
thing that way but yeah the the
cockroach game is on points the rat the
rat game is on point and I mean all we
ever hear on the Internet is that this
place is paradise and you know I mean
you know look I have nothing against
cycling I used to be a long-distance
cyclist it's not a sport I do now yeah I
cycle is a yeah part of my fitness as
well me and my pond you know yeah so
we're not anti cycling but as a place to
go cycling this is a remarkable place to
ride a bike in so many ways including
like a bitchin one I think we're gonna
talk about the streets but the rainfall
have you heard of rain it's a it's a
kryptonite to long distance lightly you
can't ride a bike in the rain here the
rain would wipe your wipe you right out
and you know it rains not infrequently
and intensely and yeah you can barely
walk in the rain when it's only been
here like five days and I've experienced
I would say what it like everything that
he's talking about it's it's not like I
see a rare occasion this is regular
Chang legs my knowledge around this time
at least right right and I mean it just
say in terms of the city's
infrastructure falling apart this thing
where the streets fill up with water
I'm sorry that's completely avoidable
even in third-world countries which this
isn't this is really the wealthiest city
in Thailand and I myself I'm living in
probably the wealthiest neighborhood of
the wealthiest city and you know I
mentioned one sense book so you walked
home late at night last night after one
or after midnight at least you know did
you see any homeless people or people
living in poverty like you don't wake on
the street that's right I didn't you
didn't snow that's what I say chiang mai
by the standards of the region even in
thailand the number of people is very
small so that wealth is obvious in many
different ways no aisles so I went to a
hospital here and got blood tests done I
did some tests before I go to China and
the hospital I'm not joking it is better
than the Austral system in where it just
was in Canada because I tried to get the
same test done in Canada before I came
here okay so I have this contrast
directly in mind and obviously by the
Asian standards so in some ways the
wealth of this society is evidence both
in the absence of kind of beggars and
almost people on the streets I've seen a
couple during daylight hours just a
couple but you know at night that you
don't see that the kind of poverty and
in the the opulence of the wealthy
members of the population and in
institutions like hospitals
but riding a bike holy every time
you cross me you're risking your life
you know you you think he's uh he's just
kind of like joking about this and make
it more severe than it actually is but
the first day I got here in Thailand in
Bangkok we were in a taxi like driving
to our apartment from the airport and
there were people driving down the
safety lane like it was a lane down the
motorway and I'm just sitting there like
what country have I come to right and
they're going in the opposite direction
oh yeah head-on collision style yeah
yeah yeah I was sitting there just like
are there any road rules and what am i
government because I actually did bring
my bike here I'm not gonna be
participating in like the the riding out
the mountain every morning but we don't
actually bring our bikes here because
I'm we've been told or everyone had
claims like this is like the safest city
in the world cuz ride your bike
what could possibly and it's like my
partner is a pretty confident driver but
she would not even drive a car here it
is yeah but I mean like like like just
even the surface of the road and like
the sidewalk if there is one the
absolutely you know there's so much of
just like the concrete falling apart and
crevices and you know
storm drains let's just say you have to
bring a fair few spare tire to do I feel
like you'll be running over a lot of
stuff right but the cars that the cars
can still kill you right I mean in terms
of the way the traffic within the city I
think you know going from one city next
outside of Chiang Mai's different but
we're talking about Chiang Mai we're not
talking at all time with time with this
one city and the conditions here so let
me ask you to think back in your mind a
little bit further like if you think
back over the last say two years I know
if it goes that far for you how do you
but okay but about a year what was it
you were expecting to find here kind of
originally when you first thought it Wan
Chiang Mai and then maybe what were you
expecting like sort of before you got on
the airplane and then what do you see
because I would think of that as a
three-phase like maybe you got a little
bit more realistic you know before he
came and then out of the actual
experience contrast to that okay so my
general kind of my understanding of
watch him I was like was basically just
based off the vlogs that I had seen by
like train ride it freely but not just
him but like everyone who attended the
first of all and basically like all I
had ever seen was just like fruit
writing up about like a mountain riding
outdoor sitive and then going out to
dinner like them no one else ever kind
of filmed anything else like walking
down the streets the sidewalks like
there was nothing else so my perception
of what Chiang Mai was going to be like
was like very warped because this is all
I had really seen so going into it I
guess it had really been painted as a
paradise like this this wonderful fruit
you get to ride up a mountain it's just
like you know taking this wonderful
vacation and some tropical paradise and
I remember I booked my tickets with with
my partner to go to attend the festival
we both this like sometime last year and
at the time I thought this is gonna be
great you know it's it's gonna be a
tropical paradise you know it was what
I'd seen was just just great there'd be
no real talk of anything negative which
was really surprising to me but um as
time went on it was like what am I gonna
be doing for 21 days in Chiang Mai like
it is this old that there really is just
like eating fruit riding up a mountain
and but but then what I'm like I started
to think about those vlogs that I'd see
on Mike what happens in between they do
the same
it's weird I mean you know look I mean
the fruit here is okay okay that's what
I'm on you know do it
I mean like you don't like I think we're
gonna see exact same thing yeah the
fruit here is okay but it's just some
people that move here for the fruit and
I'm just like you gave up everything you
had in your car the fruit but like look
for me I can't even justify that if you
moved here from Iceland like you know I
know
like so like I've lived in parts of
Canada where the fruit is terrible but
to give you an example like I bought a
medium-sized watermelon it wasn't huge
and the taste wasn't great it was it was
an okay normal watermelon and that was
100 tybo it's just okay you know I mean
the mangoes are okay a normal price
remains 30 baht and here I'm gonna
mention this before but you know minimum
wage is 300 baht per day not 300 bucks
per hour throughout the day there are a
lot of people who could never afford to
buy a mango in the shop or they couldn't
afford to buy a you know a whole
watermelon in the shop so this is also
you know in terms of all this well you
know what is a luxury and what isn't
anything we live to take it I've taken
Jake to a really cheap restaurant the
local Pinot yeah yeah I'm not gonna say
local poor people but they were
working-class people like it's not the
poorest of the poor and they're so like
a like a tourist place one drink is 75
baht and we had you know soymilk
you know vegan soy milk for 5 baht this
is how extreme the difference is and
they're like a whole meal is about 50
baht 40 50 rightfully so as opposed to
one piece of fruit for you know what
I've been other differences right crazy
so I mean you know that the prices
compared to Western rules one thing and
I mean you know I've lived in all
different parts of the world but you
know compared compared to Hong Kong
compared to South Africa I'm not I've
never lived in South Africa but I know
there are all kinds of places in the
world that have grape fruit like South
South America you live in Brazil or
something I so I mean that also they
have a lot more redeeming qualities to
go along with them apart well I you know
I it's it's a weird thing but I mean
specifically if I was planning a bike
holiday I would not plan it here it's
kind of a it's a almost uniquely
terrible place to ride bicycle
and you know what I've asked people
because I've been people's brains about
this I'm gonna ask you nail two I said
like well what what do you like about
Chiang Mai you know they they kind of
say things like well there are mountains
right yeah I mean you know with the
exception of certain parts of Arizona
like most of the world you have act you
know I mean there are some parts the
world that are you know the Netherlands
but most of the world you you can find a
mountain if you're looking for one and I
say oh and you know there are a lot of
cafes that have internet access
compared to waiter you know like
compared to South Korea compared to you
know hey but let's let's get back
because the question asked you was to
look at the idea you had yeah yeah
versus the reality so cuz again look
when you say you thought it was a
tropical paradise I don't really know
what that means to you you know means
different things different penis so how
was your idea of tropical paradise
different from what you what you
actually encountered well yeah when I
got here that was like man like my
partner can account for this like the
first few days I was like in shock I'm
like what what have I got myself now to
be fair this was Bangkok but I'm like
that's funny that's funny cuz you're
more honest with her than you are with
me I was terrible I was like having a
mental breakdown it was it was so I was
like you would not want to be around me
for those two days but it was like okay
I was in Bangkok that was a more like
establish city
what does Chiang Mai going to be like ah
so yeah I guess like that the tropical
paradise was like I said it was like
beat the amazing fruit that everyone see
like the fruit is just like 10 out of 10
here and looks like the the luxurious
with the wither like I thought okay
sunny way that what could go wrong with
that you know and just like like I say
just like living this this just like
holiday life where it's just like you
just sit around and seemingly do nothing
all day not so luxurious when you
actually get here and realize there
actually is really not much to do all
day right yeah yeah so yeah it's really
so I just say you know
thing I I think I've said I haven't said
it on YouTube but you know I I could
understand if you want to have a fruit
festival or vegan festival in Egypt you
can see the pyramids you can visit the
pyramids in Egypt if you want to have a
fruit festival in Auschwitz Poland you
can visit the concentration camp no
stress like there are places in the
world where there's a major attraction
that either has historical value or
artistic value there's some obvious
reason to be there but for me part of
what's weird is like today I was telling
you we're gonna go to the museum today
and now for me because I have a certain
kind of background I'm probably you know
we're probably gonna talk about I'm
probably gonna make it more fun for Jake
because I brought him along here yeah
we're gonna say oh this is interesting
for this reason or something have some
connection to the history and what have
you but if you don't have that
connection you know there's nothing here
that's equivalent to the pyramids
there's there's no like you know in a
sense there is no tourist attraction and
I mean in terms of activities now I
don't you bowl exploiting animals oh
yeah that's true well look no Capon look
so when people say because you will hear
this in the internet that there are tons
of like charming cafes here or chawl
bars or nightclubs that's true but if
you're a vegan who doesn't drink alcohol
ninety percent of what you see like
walking in the street means nothing to
you like really what it's like it's true
there are there were bars nightclubs
there were plenty old there was a lot of
warehouses a lot of prostitution but
again if you're a vegan you you can't
eat anything because we can't eat
anything even from the bakeries here
obviously you don't drink alcohol and
you presumably not here for prostitutes
prostitution is vegan and I'm not you
know but you know if that's not what
you're for it's it's really weird so I
mean I would just say there's a
disclaimer I'm going gonna go back to
having you talk like yeah some of my
fans make fun of me because I interview
people and I do boys I'm talking this is
an occupational hazard with me if any of
you come over to my house you'll see
it's a problem uh but you know even with
the entire land I know other cities and
actually one of my patreon supporters
was chatting about this and I think he
didn't get like I'm not saying Chiangmai
is such a terrible place
saying I have lived in and visited other
cities in Asia but also even within
Thailand that I think would be so much
better for a vacation for a living
long-term whether you're a
businessperson or what-have-you and and
I know better places riding a bicycle
because I've done the long-distance
cycling you know and where you can ride
the bicycle and where there's really
historical ancient ancient architecture
there and so on anyway so look we took
your story up to the difference between
the ideal and the shock so what came out
for the shock like cuz I mean I'll
you're on to a new phase now you're no
longer shocked like most of the meat
you've walked most of the city now yeah
you've seen I mean that's what I mean
that's what we're doing honestly for the
most part just like just walking around
yeah yeah sure and it's it's kind of a
third world channel if I'm gonna be
honest and not try paint this picture
like it's something that it isn't then
yeah I got to put words in your mouth
yeah but yeah I think a lot of people
are quite afraid to actually you say it
for what it is yeah and that's what I
wasn't expecting because I had never
seen that aspect of Chiang Mai all in
like videos people had painted this
picture where it's like this luxurious
paradise that you come to you have a
carefree holiday and it looks like you
walk around it's like all I want to do
is go back home honestly because I had
intended to stay here for 21 days with
my partner for like the entire duration
of the festival but we're gonna actually
be traveling alcohol Chiang Mai to
places like Chiang Rai and then we're
actually gonna be hitting to Singapore
because they're really oh yeah but like
but this was just like recently
organized just to see Singapore instead
of well it was like what what am I gonna
be doing here for 21 days yeah and you
know I just say so I have a background
as a scholar of Buddhism but when people
ask me for advice on what to see here I
do say to them honestly like if you're
not a specialist if you've been to three
different Buddhist temples they all
start to look the same like for a normal
person if you don't have a highly
specialized interest like I had a
scholar in that field I can't recommend
you spend your time like going to visit
every Buddhist temple and you know if
you're not a geologist I think all the
mountains look the same like you can you
can
a mountain and you could go back the
next day but you know that's that's I
have trouble giving people positive
advice about that like also to do a G I
was talking to my partner it's like if I
and I hadn't met eyes'll here of the
main tourist attraction no no I know you
hadn't been here like no cuz who else am
I gonna talk to who else that attends
the festival I'm not trying to say that
like no one knows nothing but like
seriously yeah most people who have been
here for year after year I know and they
don't speak the language you know so but
look I mean before I said it's kind of
like a third world general yeah pardon
my being honest but really I mean it's a
combination of third world problems and
first of all because we said before it
is wealthy here it's you know relative
to Thailand a relative to Asia and what
have you so that that's also a weird
part of it so I I in case you think I'm
completely - I took Jake to a nightclub
it was partly because it was one of the
Warren of the only night goes how he's
trying to seduce me
oh yeah probably building yeah sorry
probably bring him over to the dark side
the dark side ethical veganism but look
you know in that nightclub I chose it
because I know there's no prostitution
there it's not this kind of advise voice
but again so that Michael that was a
completely authentic Thai nightclubs not
for tourists the music is Thai 98% of
the people there were Thai it that is
the local culture yeah but for you as a
tourist what is it
you know and what does it have to do
with you what does it mean to you
because for me I'm normally someone who
never goes to nightclubs and not a boast
but if you make the effort to go there
and do that what's what's the connection
you know so I you know it's it's hard
work to make friends everywhere but I
don't see the appeal of that and if
you're vegan almost none of the local
you know restaurants are the view and so
on so yeah you're left with but the
circle the nightclub is wealthy that's
all so this makes it first world in
third world it's funny because I'm I
didn't go ask the question you know like
how's your trip going in Thailand and
have you been have you had any authentic
vegan food like Thai vegan food yeah and
it was like I mean I've been to some
place I haven't been to many places but
like the only
authentic Thai vegan food was when you
took me to a place that seemingly no one
else goes right it's a place that's not
for foreigners but yes that's what I
mean it's like yeah well look I mean for
me the other question is when I look at
this so I mean I feel there's a kind of
ageism going on to people who are
teenagers are in their 20s look at older
people including me but of course
they're guys who are in their fifties
sixties seventies they look at the older
people as losers because they're here on
their you're on vacation or they're here
as retirements you know in permanent
vacation but to me I look at that kind
of the flipside to me it's kind of weird
if you're in your 20s and you don't have
any ambition and I told you Smee an
ambition earned money but ambition to
have a career or ambition to change the
world mission to do something and you go
on this kind of long term vacation here
it's weird that those people are looking
down their nose at people who actually
did work a job for 40 years and then
retired you know what you guys are the
losers oh you old people you're not
you're not cool because but I mean I I
don't know what's cool about it and
again if you did have a job here or you
were doing humanitarian work something
that engage you with the society that
could be rewarding that could plug you
into the reality of Chiangmai but if you
don't you know whether you're here as a
so-called digital nomad or on vacation
you know I think what's meaningful here
you know the struggle you know what life
is like for real people enjoy mine you
have you have no connection with either
look I know when I first brought him to
my street yeah this is soon after you
arrived I warned him I said look this is
one of the best streets of the city the
rest are all I can say you know you hear
these things from him you're like really
and then a few days then you're like oh
well he was right well whether whether
you're walking we've drawn a bicycle the
scenery moves more quickly and I guess
it doesn't feel as hot you get a bit
more of a breeze but god damn it's ugly
walking past the 7-elevens just the the
rotting broken-down building
one after another I had people on my
facebook were saying to me like I had
just a photo of me doing something there
like they couldn't believe the
incredibly ugly powerlines and just the
sense that everything is rotting not to
mention that's infested with rats and so
on it's like it's like even if you go to
my apartment just look out the window
you've got buildings that are like half
being taken down and half being yeah and
they just they just send this right this
slate of like nothing's ever going to
happen to them they're just sitting
there as they are yeah well that's okay
so that touches on another interesting
thing which is the Chiang Mai I think
when I was here ten years ago there was
optimism for its future and there was a
ton of new investments including in
tourism and now when I walked the city's
humid the empty buildings
I see empty buildings of every kind like
I see empty office buildings empty
houses some abandoned like halfway
through construction but some complete
and the business set of businesses gone
but especially in tourism like obviously
tours have hit a peak at some point the
past and then declined but you know
nightclubs hotels tourist oriented
buildings and tourist arranging
restaurants there are tons of them that
are abandoned even in the wealthiest
parts of the city the most durable and
in the downtown core the downtown core
is really kind of rotting and in
floating you know but look sir I don't I
don't want to seem like I'm beating you
up Jake it's so many reality but look so
many things I don't get it like um you
know people including like people I like
your Jenna I've been all the close
friends people who know me they invite
me to go to a night market like I know
what a night market is it's it's some
I'm not been to them I've walked through
them you know but it's some plastic
stalls and it's stinking hot and you're
sweating drenched in sweat it's some
plastic stalls in a parking lot at night
that's what it is and 90% of what
they're selling is not vegan
it's either meat or alcohol and it's
nothing to do it like what's fun about
it what's so great they seems to be this
thing of like trying to memorize
something that's not glamorous yeah
because that's all that that's what
they've got to work with because there
is nothing glamorous in the first place
about being in Chiang Mai yeah and I
it's sad that so many people aren't
willing to talk about what they really
see or if they even really see it it was
just
cuz like you can't miss it like walking
down the sidewalk you can't miss just
like the rubble and the trash just
literal rubble like not kidding it's
just like it's like it's like they've
started constructing the sidewalk
they've got to finish it they've got all
the mess left and they're just like well
let's just leave it there so look for
this video we're not gonna get into it
but I say we've talked about this out
camera I feel like on a larger scale the
fact that Thailand's democracy has
collapsed
you know the failure of government here
the fact that this is now a military
dictatorship I feel this is related to
bad governments as you see it in these
things that in a sense you know the fact
that the government is failing to manage
the sidewalks and just obvious things
and then the you know the raining rain
water reflects the fact that currently
you know there is no Prime Minister
there is no Constitution there are no
civil rights that this this country was
taken over as military tissue so and
that's happened repeatedly in the last
10 years they've had long periods of
this so you know some level of
mismanagement or worse than it would be
management to those public public
problems is is perhaps inevitable yeah
it's uh it's interesting because I
remember watching one of your videos and
you were really upset by the fact that
no one is willing to talk about this no
one who seems like like they can and I
remember kind of you know kind of
sympathizing with you and me like oh
yeah I kind of understand where it's
like but when you actually get here and
you witness just how bad it is and you
see all these people just walking around
just not talking about it's like how can
you not yeah to even admit it to
yourself like that this isn't the place
that you're portraying it to be it's
it's it's sad it really is yeah just
like I like a little story also about
like this is kind of somewhat unrelated
but I'm talking about the street
flooding once again it's one of those
things like eyes will send it to me I'm
like I surely can't be that bad right so
we we were at a restaurant eating dinner
together and the charming that we had
this week I was okay by see right
I would say like five minutes later the
sky is just opened and it was like I
think they refer to it as elephant rain
someone told me I don't know what yeah
bucket it down and within five minutes I
could you knock the streets were just
like you could row a boat down there it
was yeah yeah you know like when you say
stinks things when he says these things
on camera he really isn't exaggerating
and to like make it sound like it's
worse than it is like if you have your
eyes open and you're not in this little
world of like yeah and that's what yeah
well so I mean you know so you know wrap
it up it partly is the the Instagram
effect yes change in a moment to your
life that are the most beautiful or what
have you but I think there's there are
many other kinds of self-deception going
on and ultimately I mean I think the the
cost is a loss of potential I just want
to say some people misrepresent what I
say about the vegans and shame I is if I
think you're all idiots I don't I think
you could be doing something better with
your time I think you have the potential
to be selling better even within
Thailand or even within Chiang Mai you
know that's why I talk about social
engagement well I think you should be
concerned about the government about
politics about these problems if I
thought you you were Complete Idiot's I
wouldn't care I'd say well that and you
know look think about how you guys if
you guys are watching this the young the
young people who think you're hip and
cool even shame I how do you guys feel
about the retired guys who over 70 years
old who sit here you don't look to them
to save the world you don't look to them
to make the world a better place think
well he's 75 years old he's just retired
and drinks beer in a bar somewhere
well I can't look at you that way you
know I really am looking I'm looking to
members of my own generation and Jake's
generation Jake is a few years younger
than me obviously I'm looking for us to
take responsibility to shoulder that
burden to make Thailand a better place
to make chain my a better place if you
choose to live in Chiang Mai and whether
it's through veganism ecology other
forms of activism organization to be
concerned and and not just to live a
life that revolves around fresh fruit
bikinis and bicycles but goddamn limited
have you seen one bikini it's let's cut
it off there all right</div>
