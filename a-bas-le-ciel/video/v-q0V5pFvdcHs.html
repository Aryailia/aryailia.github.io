    <h1>The Problem of "the Exotic" in Philosophy & Religion</h1>
    <p>18 March 2014 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0V5pFvdcHs">[link youtube]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>This opens with an anecdote from the bad old days about monks, magic and faith-healing, then proceeds to (briefly) run through the problem of "the exotic" (as I've encountered it) in both Eastern and Western philosophy.<br><br><br><br>The drink in the blender was a combination of banana, kiwi and soymilk, for the record.</p>
