like any kind of like solidarity in the
vegan community what we need to do is
have like you know really just like a
big one like message that we're sending
out there and just everybody just needs
to get on board with that message and
you know the thing about it is it's like
individuality and you know
self-expression you know of like
individual expression is the most
important thing okay so that's number
one all right so if we just all get
together and we just you know hammer in
that we need to have this you know one
message that we're sitting out there to
the mainstream you know that's really
just going to help this community and
help our cause so all I wanna say is you
know just go out there and you know keep
doing the drama and my message to people

this person doing that thing and I'm
going to tell you right now there are
people in this community that I will
