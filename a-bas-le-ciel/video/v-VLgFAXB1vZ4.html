    <p>When you talk to people about endangered languages, quite often the first reaction you get is a denial that the language could ever disappear. Then, after just a few minutes of discussion, they tend to reflect on just how soon the language might be entirely extinct.<br><br><br><br>The video mentions my past work on Hokkien (閩南語, 台語, 廈門話), posted to my blog; you can find some examples of that, here: <a href="http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.tw/search/label/H%C5%8D-l%C3%B3">http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.tw/search/label/H%C5%8D-l%C3%B3</a><br><br><br><br>In the video I mention an informal article that was published in Ogmios; it discusses some of the same issues using very different examples.  You can find that online here: <a href="https://medium.com/@eiselmazard/endangered-languages-in-and-around-laos-an-overview-of-opportunities-1e7232a1e3a4">https://medium.com/@eiselmazard/endangered-languages-in-and-around-laos-an-overview-of-opportunities-1e7232a1e3a4</a></p>
