    <hr>
    <p>PlantBasedNews must (repeat: must) issue a retraction and an apology for the false claims you made about me (and my "financial misconduct") and they should be willing to report THE REAL FACTS of the case instead.  I told the truth about this case AT EVERY STAGE, and many other vegans lined up for their opportunity to defame me.  Klaus, IF YOUR CHANNEL is regarded as more trustworthy (as "news") than Durianrider, you must realize that a lie of this kind (told to 29,000 people) does serious harm to my reputation: you know this is false, and you have been totally irresponsible in how you handled this affair.  PlantBasedNews may be a scam, but Ã -bas-le-ciel is not.</p>

    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">absolutely seems to be a fine condoms<br />odd yeah
aisel has said a lot of stuff that I
really kind of gravitated towards he's
also used the term permanent vacation
which I do believe at least in context
of veganism he did coin so I will credit
him with that I think there's a lot of
truth to that as well so I wouldn't say
I'm a big fan of his though as of today
why do they need to you hear sleeve
money yeah imagine to show you that why
would you donate to him you hear sleeve
money yeah there's a lot of evidence to
show you houses right
he said you using it to get vegan
ichi-chan taking down
you rascai hey he actually was trying to
take a youtuber to jail I believe is he
wants this youtuber in jail is what he
said yeah the exact thing that I do
regret doing that that was wrong I
shouldn't have donated and promoted that
fundraiser the way I did I do apologize
