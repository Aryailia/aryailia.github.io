    <h2>Youtube Automatic Transcription</h2>
    <div class="transcription">lately it's been a rat for my people and<br />gyro actually what goes around and come
around the spiral Factory the globe used
to be black you see no vitiligo I go

drain all of this Walter [ __ ] damn I
do this we've been asked out mean y'all
knew this yet they sell us cold b12
pocket did it sell us clothes YouTube
and Instagram is not what it used to be
for me I'm still so passionate about
spreading the vegan message I'm simply
doing it in a few other ways because I
never got the financial rewards from
YouTube to support me like I don't I
don't even make an income out of this at
all I don't even make $100 enough to get
like a paycheck from YouTube
static I just told my people rise we ask
to be treated equal the biggest cable
equalizer equalizer watch by the eagle
I've been fearing me no crime going seen

you think they choose the black for
slave could a white dissolve out with a
satellite and yet they trapped us all in
this firmament to be kinda like saddle
up [ __ ] I was christened before knowing
who I was now my mission is more flowing
Norma Gucci no more proud of no
Christian Dior showing entomology for
Lucifer ah the your call it going I will
not move
plot move listen my mission is to drop
jewels I'm poised to howl I got some
scary dude standing up for Terry Crews I
don't know how to something positive I
want to you know when I die I want to
know that I left some at least want to
know that I helped someone but YouTube
and Instagram is not what it used to be
for me like I don't I don't even make an
income out of this at all I don't even
make $100 enough to get like a paycheck
from YouTube I'm still so passionate
about spreading the vegan message I'm
simply doing it in a few other ways
because I never got the financial
rewards from YouTube to support me it
takes too much time and there's other
things in life that I need to pursue
reason I'm touching myself so much as
mosquitoes of course so that's why I
guess I'm not a youtuber in the same
capacity as I used to be and I figured
out other ways to make some cash and
that is why if you look at my and I'm
not blaming anyone on that but myself
all my friends that are killing it
Alysse raw alignment Mady limb burner so
many people who are just crushing it on
YouTube and doing like a nomadic
lifestyle like me but through YouTube
all the power to them I'm just not as
good of a filmmaker and I'm not as good
of an entertainer I guess cuz I still
get a thousand or 2,000 views per video
whereas some of my peers who have been
putting in similar amounts of work are
getting a lot more and the only person
to blame for that is me I don't have
great cameras I'm not the best editor
and so that's just what has happened
like I don't I don't even make an income
out of this at all I don't even make a
hundred dollars enough to get like a
paycheck from YouTube um
which kind of sucks to be honest but
that's what are you gonna do you know
when I just started becoming more
popular
I was speaking I think so many more
people on my YouTube channel like I
would get comments every day from people
saying you veganize me helps me stay
vegan like you're awesome blah blah blah
and nowadays like I don't feel like I'm
doing anything meaningful to anyone and
I don't know how to do anything
meaningful like I don't know how to like
convert this into something positive I
mean really people like to disrespect my
truth but the fact is that you know my
name is I don't know</div>
