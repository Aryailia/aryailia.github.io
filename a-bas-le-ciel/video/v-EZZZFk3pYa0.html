    <h1>Buddhist Meditation is NOT a Science of the Mind</h1>
    <p>14 March 2014 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZZFk3pYa0">[link youtube]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <p>In one important aspect, the problem with Buddhist Meditation is strangely similar to Christian Creationism.  (Recorded while sick with a bad fever [發燒], BTW, so my voice is a bit creaky.)<br><br><br><br>If you've got the patience to read more:<br><br>"...we must not forget that the English word meditation denotes a European concept, not a Buddhist one.  We find the term in the popular translation of the "Meditations" of Marcus Aurelius ([馬爾庫斯·奧列里烏斯] 121--180 A.D.) —scil., a title that is also translated as "private thoughts" or simply as "notes to myself". This shows the range of meanings that the English term has encompassed in recent centuries: it has been used to denote everything from Christian prayer to solipsistic thinking, and includes autobiographical reflections in-between."<br><br>From a long article: <a href="https://medium.com/p/1c31959b2e56">https://medium.com/p/1c31959b2e56</a></p>
