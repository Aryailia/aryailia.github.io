It is a fascinating case-study in terms of both international geopolitics, and revolutionary violence.

        <p class="description">A lot of vegans complain about "never being taken seriously", but what level of respect (or "seriousness") can we really expect in these interactions?  Although I really do relate to vegans feeling that they're constantly insulted and challenged by meat-eaters… but the reality is, often enough, we're also the ones doing the challenging… and the people we're talking to didn't sign up to attend an animal rights conference.

        <p class="description">Veganism is not the moral baseline: the wilderness is the moral baseline.  The only ethical "treatment of animals" is recognizing their autonomy in their own habitat --and (for practical reasons) in 2016 human beings need to adopt laws to protect that habitat (and to limit human encroachment into it).  There is no moral way to reduce a wild animal to being a human plaything: neither in the case of a "pet dog", nor "a pet monkey", nor "a pet lion" (and arguments to the contrary, making exceptions for dogs, are, indeed, "speciesism" of the most odious kind).  It does not matter if you justify a "captive animal" as a "companion animal", and it does not matter if you (as a human) define the conditions of their captivity as "happy": the only moral relationship with animals is with wild animals.  Animals that have been crippled (neutered, etc.) so that they will conform to behaviors imposed on them by humans (training, domestication, etc.) can never provide a "moral baseline" for vegans/veganism.  Never.</p>

At the time of the recording, Jason and Henya were trying to make clear that their commitment is to veganism ("just veganism") and not to any particular diet, and their goals are, ultimately, to help the animals, not to promote an athletic lifestyle.  What, now, is the (practical) way forward for vegans after the collapse of most of the hopes that had been attached to the Chiang Mai scene?

As is stated in the first few seconds of this video, I think the underlying problem is one of dealing with questions of ethics in our (21st century) culture, and of stating subjective claims in contrast to "global" (or even cosmological) claims about right and wrong.<br><br><br><br>And, yes, this video does (INEVITABLY) digress into examples from Laos and Cambodia.

His needs (and his ability to gain weight) will be radically different from those of an average/healthy person.<br><br><br><br>His experience with the disease might have given him some terrible experiences with the side-effects of cortico-steroids, and, more generally, the extent to which people suffering from the condition will have extreme changes in their (subjective) health corresponding to (sometimes minor) changes in their diet.<br><br><br><br>For someone with Crohn's disease, switching to a vegan, high-fiber diet, could indeed come as "a revelation", if their former diet had been aggravating their symptoms.  What he says about fatigue, having enough energy, etc., suddenly "makes sense" when you know that he has Crohn's disease (even though it is TERRIBLE advice for 99% of the population!).<br><br><br><br>In the video linked to below, D.R. sincerely says that eating A HUGE QUANTITY of carbs will "cure" chronic fatigue syndrome; from anyone else, this would just sound crazy (or stupid… certainly unscientific)… but it is actually easy to imagine how someone struggling with Crohn's disease could perceive things this way.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/kTgozmZCHcU?t=1m5s">https://youtu.be/kTgozmZCHcU?t=1m5s</a><br><br><br><br>If he were honest and scientifically-rigorous about it, Durianrider's experience probably could be useful for other people with Crohn's disease to learn from (and they may be the only people who really could/should eat 30 bananas per day!)… but, instead, he has been dishonest, insulting and extremely aggressive, (1) imagining himself to be miraculously cured, and (2) dismissing anyone who doesn't get results similar to his own as secretly eating hamburgers (etc.), claiming that gaining weight on his diet is "impossible" (etc.)… when, in reality, his perspective and experience are shaped by an extreme and incurable disease.  Sad.<br><br><br><br>It already was a strange irony that a guy who had been diagnosed with anorexia (and as an ex-drug-addict, etc.) was in his position (of leading a fad diet)… but it is even more ironic that this role is being played by someone with such a serious illness, with such a conflicted attitude toward his own illness, and who projects his own experience (struggling to eat enough to feel energetic, etc.) onto people who do not share the digestive problems (malabsorption-of-nutrients, etc.) of Crohn's disease.</p>

        <p class="description">A discussion of effective activism (for veganism and ecology) that, as always, veers into minor questions of the meaning of life.  No matter how rewarding you may find it to attend a particular demonstration today, you have to ask yourself what it is leading toward, 5 years from now, when the charm of protesting at that restaurant (or even that slaughterhouse) will have worn off.  Passion only takes you so far, and then we have to wonder about how organization can take you further.<br><br><br><br>The link to an earlier video is mentioned in passing (title: "Veganism: Neither Anti-Capitalist Nor 'A Privilege'"), and you can find that video here: <a href="https://youtu.be/QiuBSwTFD1U">https://youtu.be/QiuBSwTFD1U</a></p>

        <p class="description">In recent videos I reflected on the extent to which anarchism had gone out of style (as a leitmotif in Animal Rights and veganism), and, in this video, I'm instead discussing what the role of the state is (or might be presumed to be) in vegans' vaguely-stated plans for social and ecological change.<br><br><br><br>As a society, we'd like to eliminate cigarette smoking… and yet we've had the maturity to attempt to pursue that goal without making tobacco illegal.  Is the end-goal of veganism to make meat illegal in the same sense as heroin or cocaine?  I doubt it, but there are some complex issues to be debated, from several (incompatible) perspectives.</p>

        <p class="description">Political activism isn't always ugly: it can be creative, and even beautiful.

        <p class="date">02 March 2016 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijsSdEP9zLE">[YT link]</a></p>
        <p class="description">The lesser of two evils is still evil.  However, in praxis, a large part of habitat-conservation is linked to hunting, and a large part of self-determination movements for indigenous people (e.g., land-rights for First Nations) are --also-- linked to hunting.<br><br><br><br>This video reflects on the complex questions of wilderness vs. domestication (in how we conceptualize nature itself as well as our activism), and how they connect to the A.R. movement's peculiar (and changing) attitudes toward indigenous (First Nations) politics, etc.</p>

        <p class="description">If you'd like to see the earlier video alluded to (of my daughter playing with some of the gifts I brought her in December --and don't worry, the video is under 5 minutes long), click here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mclBtU07DE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mclBtU07DE</a><br><br><br><br>Matt & Nat is a vegan brand of designer purses (and no, this is neither a paid endorsement, nor an unpaid endorsement, as I lack expertise in this area).

        <p class="description">Meanwhile, for anyone who wants to talk, don't act like it's hard to find me: my e-mail is posted publicly (along with my real name) all over the internet: <a href="http://www.eisel-mazard.com/">http://www.eisel-mazard.com/</a><br><br><br><br>I have plenty of quality interaction with my viewers (and plenty of y'all are quality people).  Many of my videos refer to this (or reply directly to questions received by e-mail, etc.).  The difference is that e-mail is written to me (directly), and thus rarely has the vapid and over-the-top quality of attempts to grandstand for attention (anonymously) in a comments section.  To me, that's a meaningful difference.  Maybe, if you can imagine yourself in my situation, that would be a meaningful difference for you, too.<br><br><br><br>But if not, hey: on your Youtube channel, you can play by your rules.</p>
