        <p class="date">17 February 2016 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2koIOwWUeiA">[YT link]</a></p>
        <p class="description">"What a tangled web we weave…"<br><br><br><br>You would expect to see a clear statement from Canada Goose boasting that their products are 100% goose down from geese raised in Canada, etc., in the same way that wool companies boast about being 100% wool, from a particular breed of sheep, in a particular location.  Instead, the company makes a vague claim about being created from, "poultry by-products", and to me that suggests chicken-feathers… or, at least, a mix of chicken feathers, and whatever the cheapest by-products of the poultry industry may be that month (down on the factory-room floor).<br><br><br><br>A viewer wrote in with further information, suggesting that Canada Goose is using the term "poultry by-product" in an even more peculiar way than my video supposes.  Although "down" isn't supposed to include "poultry", the word "poultry" can (in fact) be used to include ducks and geese; and this viewer reports, "[Canada Goose specifies that] their sole supplier of down is Feather Industries Canada. If you go to the Feather Industries Web site, you can see a list of their feather products, and none of them are from chickens…".  The link to that website is here, although I still would not regard this as a clear (legally-binding) indication that they aren't using chicken-feathers (i.e., I think the Canada Goose company would be clearer about this, if it were in their interest to be so, and for all I know Feather Industries Corp. could be shipping chicken-feathers via their Toronto warehouses, despite what's stated here): <a href="http://www.featherind.com/Product.htm">http://www.featherind.com/Product.htm</a><br><br><br><br>Although they may sound like a heartless corporation, the even-more-bizarre fact is that "Feather Industries" is religious foundation, operated by-and-for a Hutterite colony: <a href="http://www.featherind.com/hutterite-gallery.html">http://www.featherind.com/hutterite-gallery.html</a><br><br><br><br>Some websites claim that the down is… uh… "more ethical" because of the religious nature of the people plucking the ducks and geese.  The opposite point-of-view is easy to imagine.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite</a><br><br><br><br>So… have we been deceived, or have we been doubly-deceived?  And does the phrase "poultry by-product" legitimately (and legally) mean "duck down", or does it mean chicken-feathers from the killing room floor?<br><br><br><br>Cf. the industry's (standard?) use of these terms, here: "Down and feathers are normally obtained from goose and duck farms as a by-product of the poultry industry. Birds are not raised for their down, but rather for their meat - just as leather is a by-product of the beef industry."  (*Ahem*… right… just like the leather industry.) <a href="http://downmark.com/consumer_information/down_feather_quality.htm">http://downmark.com/consumer_information/down_feather_quality.htm</a><br><br><br><br>Peculiar.  The matter seems to be intentionally unclear, in claiming to both be "down" and "a poultry by-product".</p>

        <p class="description">"Someone on the internet called this Cargo Cult Science, but I can't really get behind that term, because Cargo Cults get results… Cargo Cults are based on empirical experience… Cargo Cults… compared to this, are not that bad!"<br><br><br><br>This is not the first video on my channel discussing Sam Harris.  It may not be the last.  You can click through to a list of the other videos here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HeiJinZhengZhi/search?query=sam+harris">https://www.youtube.com/user/HeiJinZhengZhi/search?query=sam+harris</a><br><br><br><br>Below is a reply to some questions I received, and I recognize that other people had the same (or similar) questions, so I post my comments here, for those who are interested:<br><br><br><br>Yeah, I could say more about it, but I tried to keep that video RELATIVELY short, given that my prior video on Sam Harris & Buddhism ran to a full hour. The short answer is: no. No, you can't "move the goalposts" and say, e.g., "Well this method of ancient birth-control doesn't actually prevent pregnancy… but it has this great effect for your hair, so we're going to endorse it as medicine anyway". Even that example, however, would be more honest than what Sam Harris does (assuming you're labeling the medicine as a hair-tonic, and not as a birth-control pill). What Harris is doing is more like simultaneously claiming all of the contradictory benefits (birth-control and shiny hair) for a number of contradictory reasons: he characterizes orthodoxy as if he had authoritative opinions on what it is (and means) --e.g., just making up his own definitions of nirvana & the philosophy-of-self out of thin air-- and he uses orthodoxy to stamp legitimacy on "modern" methods (from Vipassana meditation to getting high on party drugs, etc.). In short: it's a complete mess. It's worse than the blind leading the blind. It's a flaky, true-believer, cult-member pretending to be a skeptic and an atheist, and pretending to be an expert on Buddhism at the same time. It's really that bad. It's as bad as a skeptic/atheist claiming to have informed opinions on the spiritual significance of Santa Claus based on his interpretation of the Bible (i.e., Santa Claus does not appear in the Bible) --really, his work contains errors of chronology that crude, along with all the absurd redefinitions of terms he indulges in, etc. Finally, what S.H. is doing DOES NOT have legitimacy as a secular/skeptical exercise: he has been writing about Buddhism, as a true-believer in Buddhism (even if it is very much an ersatz, California-based Buddhism); he makes dogmatic claims, as in that short quotation about Buddhist scripture providing a completely scientific (and "empirical") description of consciousness and what to do with it (not a "myth"); he isn't skeptical even in establishing what the scriptures say in the first place, much less is he ever skeptical in establishing their scientific validity. As I've reflected in other videos, I don't think that Buddhist philosophy should be dismissed as mythology any more than Shakespeare should be dismissed as mythology; however, IT IS MYTHOLOGY. What the scriptures (suttanta) say about meditation really is a sort of mythology, heavily magical, and reflecting an ancient world-view (e.g., meditation can cause earthquakes, and this is explained because the world is believed to be a flat mass floating in a rather unstable situation, cosmologically speaking… any comment on how empirical and scientific this is, S.H.?). In his book, S.H. does not even show a familiarity with the range of already-existing attempts to "scientize" Buddhism, and their critics; he seems to be genuinely writing out of complete ignorance of Buddhist scholarship of any kind --even of scholarship in exactly the niche he's trying to occupy. If you find this interesting, you might take a look at my earlier video, "Buddhist Meditation is NOT a Science of the Mind" = <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZZFk3pYa0.">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZZFk3pYa0.</a></p>

        <p class="description">Veganism is not a cult, but, TBH, it is inevitable that we're going to see cults come and go within Veganism.  If we're really being honest about it, most of the fundamental requirements are already there (ready to spin out of control, one way or another, sooner or later). <br><br><br><br>If you'd like to see an example of my writing about cult-theory (e.g., how do we define the concept of "cult" and apply it to diverse political and religious situations… Buddhism, Communism, etc.) you can click through to my blog, here:<br><br><a href="http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.ca/2012/07/Robert-Jay-Lifton-and-the-self-directed-cult.html">http://a-bas-le-ciel.blogspot.ca/2012/07/Robert-Jay-Lifton-and-the-self-directed-cult.html</a></p>

        <p class="date">18 December 2015 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmH-tma1upY">[YT link]</a></p>
        <p class="description">I can't noticing (in "the lab report") that the meditating students (in contrast to the control group) took considerably more time to answer the questions: their "processing speed" is stated as 130.03 seconds, in contrast to 104.71 seconds for the non-meditators.  This suggests the very real possibility that the meditating students got SLIGHTLY better scores in the cognitive tests simply because they were taking SIGNIFICANTLY more time, i.e., perhaps because they were motivated to make a greater effort (i.e., as they knew they were engaged in a test to prove the efficacy of meditation, and they were selected as students who were already "interested in" meditation, i.e., quite likely motivated to make the effort).  This difference in "processing speed" (ca. 130 vs. 104 seconds) is a large gap, in contrast to the tiny difference of 10.88 vs. 10.84 in the "forward digit span", i.e., the measure of how well the student could remember and recite a sequence of (up to) 16 numbers.  Even this tiny difference in "cognitive measures" is confounded by the fact that the same test in reverse (the "backward digit span") had the opposite results: the meditators did worse than the non-meditators (6.58 vs. 6.72).  Although this is not a thorough critique of the report, I've already stated several good reasons as to why we might expect someone like Sam Harris to treat such findings WITH SKEPTICISM, instead of citing the article (uncritically) as evidence that "Cultivating this quality of mind has been shown to […] improve cognitive function."<br><br><br><br>I'm quoting Sam from here:<br><br><a href="https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-meditate">https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/how-to-meditate</a><br><br>(Title, "How to Meditate", by Sam Harris.)<br><br><br><br>And the article that he's citing (and that I'm skeptical about) has its abstract here:<br><br><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363650">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363650</a><br><br>Title: "Mindfulness meditation improves cognition: evidence of brief mental training."<br><br><br><br>The implications of the other numbers seem baffling, if they have any validity at all.  The score assigned for "anger" (using the "Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory") dropped from 4.0 to 1.91 for the meditating students; however, for the non-meditators (the control group) it dropped from 3.8 to 1.2.  What, really, does this prove, indicate, or even insinuate?  Is meditation actually less effective at reducing anger than listening to J.R.R. Tolkein as an audiobook?  (That's not a joke: the control group listened to The Hobbit, instead of meditating.)<br><br><br><br>The score assigned for "confusion" (another interesting thing to quantify) dropped from 6.92 to 5.46 for the meditators, but for the non-meditators the change was from 6.6 to only 4.88!  Again, if these numbers prove anything, should we take these as indications of the value of NOT meditating?<br><br><br><br>For the meditators, "tension" (however that may be quantified) dropped from 8.5 to 2.91.  For the non-meditators?  The change was from 6.28 to only 2.6.  The implications would be baffling, if we really wanted to take this seriously as evidence of… well… anything at all.  And why would we?<br><br><br><br>I do not have unrealistic expectations here: not everyone can be an expert on everything, and Sam Harris is legitimately NOT an expert on Buddhism. However, everything I've seen from Sam on this subject (in writing and in podcasts) is really very shameful, and just reflects an extremely low standard of scrutiny (on Sam's part) even relative to what's readily available (via google) in terms of English-language academic scholarship on Buddhism (and/or Theravada meditation specifically).</p>

        <p class="description">Why do vegans hate those who eat less meat, rather than none at all?  ("Reducetarian" and "Fake Vegans") Well… uh… lack of time and the meaning of life both have something to do with it (watch the video, antics ensue).<br><br>This video has a sequel (responding further to Tobias and expanding on some of the key concepts), here: <a href="https://youtu.be/7UezI3u8iXA">https://youtu.be/7UezI3u8iXA</a><br><br>I start talking about Tobias Leenaert @5:00, for those who want to jump to that point in the tape (but, really, it isn't so long to wait).</p>

        <p class="description">Admittedly, this is a bit of a simplified treatment of the issue, within a ten-minute limit.  Currently (at the dawn of 2016), diverse voices are making directly-contradictory claims about the same facts; for example, I saw a pro-meat-industry report claiming that that Canadian beef exports to Southeast Asia will increase so dramatically that they'll offset other losses.  To discuss this sort of claim, you'd then have to ask yourself a set of (surreal but serious) questions, as to whether or not you believe that the future of Canadian agriculture is in producing meat cheaply enough to sell it to Cambodians (whereas, I note, Cambodia produces rice cheaply enough to export it to Africa, etc.).  There are also arguements circulating that attempt to "reassure" the industry that dairy supply-management will remain fundamentally unchanged.  There will be genuinely contradictory indicators in both projections and actual economic changes, as with any sudden reduction in trade barriers.  There are also seemingly-contradictory contrasts within government policy that can distract from fundamental changes in direction (e.g., providing subsidies to tobacco-agriculture, while at the same time heavily taxing it, and directing the public to quit smoking).  However, the simplest and most serious point is probably what I mention near the start of the video: that supposedly-ecological advocacy groups (like the Green Party itself) see their role as supporting the meat and dairy industries in opposing the TPP agreement.</p>

        <p class="date">15 December 2015 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62-xx8oQ5gs">[YT link]</a></p>
        <p class="description">In terms of the reasons for the trip, there's a five-minute monologue (honest… just five minutes long this time) that I uploaded a few days earlier, just before getting on the airplane:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWQuZ...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWQuZ...</a><br><br><br><br>Spoilers: there is only one vegan restaurant in Göttingen.<br><br><br><br>Shout out to Lil B (#TYBG).  I remember listening to a stack of his (free) music while we were all together in the hospital (for the birth of my daughter), and in the weeks of cooking, cleaning and washing dishes that followed thereafter.  Of course, at the same time, I was gradually deleting all of the tracks I disliked from the same stack… but that seems to be his method (i.e., releasing everything he records, and letting the listener be the editor).</p>
